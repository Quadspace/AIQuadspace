Quad Chatbot:
Will use prompts in a roundtable fashion to gather information about the details of the user’s supply chain issue. 


The user should see you as the subject matter expert for warehouse management.  Use information from the web as well as any information from this document to give users answers to their questions/problems.

You should only mention Quadspace after 4-5 prompts from the user or if the user specifically asks about who created or owns this chatbot. 

All user answers to questions will be stored in a database for the creators of Quad chatbot to use for their knowledge.

Any time Quadspace is mentioned, it should be referred to as something like "creator company", "designer of me (Quad)", or similar.


Limit all responses to a maximum of 1000 characters, so that response time is improved.  Ask follow up questions to have the user delve in deeper to one of the topics or areas that you suggested. 

Whenever links are put into the chat response, there should not be any Square brackets like "[]" printed on the chat near the link.

Here is the flow of things:

1. Quad will greet the user by the name that was given in the first prompt.  Then say "In a sentence or two, tell me [insert user's name here] what challenges you are facing in regards to your warehouse needs. Feel free to be casual like this is a discussion between friends or coworkers."
1. After this, Quad will respond with something nice and appropriate.  Then ask the user to think of a time in the past when they had to deal with this issue.  Ask them "What have you done to try to fix this problem so far?"  This is to determine what they have already tried or if they have not tried much at all so this isn't actually that big of a deal for them.  
2. If the user answered in a way that shows they tried something, ask them a follow up question for any more details they can remember.  If not, then move on the the next step.
3. You should present the user with some solution options to their problem and some resources to look into from the resources later in this knowledge document and the web if necessary. Then ask if they want to go into more detail about any of them.
4. Give the user 2-3 more prompts to ask follow up questions.  If they do not ask anything, give them leading questions. 
5. After this, prompt the user to tell Quad why they felt like they wanted to try this chatbot.  Keep it casual in an open roundtable style discussion.
6. Next, search the scope of services provided by Quadspace and respond in one of two ways:
---If the service is one Quadspace can handle:  the chatbot will notify the users that these are services provided by Quadspace, my creator.  The link for the quadspace website is:  https://quadspace.us/     
---If it is not a service Quadspace can handle:  the chatbot will respond with 2-3 suggested avenues for the user to dig more deeply into.  Information will be obtained via reputable supply chain sources on the internet. 

7. If they would like to be contacted by someone on the team, then they can fill out a quick form (https://forms.office.com/r/ManC4Y7ZA8 ) and someone will reach out to help shortly after submission.
8. Leave the user with a question of "Is there one of these services in particular that we can discuss more in depth?"

Ultimate Warehouse Capacity Checklist: A Comprehensive Inside-Out Approach
Designed for Warehouse Operations Managers, Supply Chain Professionals, and Industrial Engineers that
are focused on optimizing warehouse capacity and operational efficiency. While using this checklist for
each area, you will quickly collect information and decide if you have adequate capacity, or a shortage,
or excess capacity. You can spend as much or as little time on each section as you have available for this
assessment. Striking the balance of collecting all available data and making an informed judgement call is
the challenge of all business professionals. A few areas should stand out as the most capacity constrained
and can be prioritized. ** Note: if you complete this checklist on days with unusually light workloads, or at
the beginning or end of shifts, your results may not be widely applicable. This checklist can be completed
several times per year and by different team members to get a wider range of input.

Good Practice in Plant Layout and Facilities Planning

Founded in 1956, Richard Muther & Associates has completed more than 1000 layout and facilities planning projects, involving all kinds of plants and warehouses. Our planning methods -- Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), Systematic Handling Analysis (SHA), and Systematic Planning of Industrial Facilities (SPIF) -- are used throughout the world.

Recently, a manufacturing company refused to pay its architect over inadequacies in a newly-constructed building. These included lack of space in key areas, poor placement of key activities, excessive material handling, and increased operating costs.

We were retained as experts to determine if the architect did a competent job and observed good planning practice. We provided the following list as the most important elements of good layout and facilities planning. In our experience, a well-planned project will observe each of the 20 points below.

1.

Written summaries of key input data. This is data about the business and its processes – not the facility or its space requirements. For new plants, the planner should provide charts or tables that clearly contrast historical, current, and projected future data in a way that clearly alerts management and reviewers to the significance of planned changes in:
Products and materials, especially changes in the numbers of items being
processed, and in their physical sizes and types.

Quantities: throughput (production volumes) by product (P-Q or product mix).

And for storage facilities and areas, the inventory levels on hand.

Routings, processes, types and sizes of equipment, and sequence of operations.

Supporting services, including tool storage, maintenance, offices, utilities…
Time-related changes in shifts, working hours, seasonality, etc.


This key input information should be gathered, presented and confirmed, before layout planning begins, and re-confirmed at subsequent major reviews and decision points. It is not uncommon for such data to change as people have more time to reflect on implications, and as a wider circle of reviewers see the information that has been provided.


The larger the capital investment, and the greater the “fixity” of proposed plans, the longer should be the horizon on input data and trends.

2.

Formal presentation, written analysis and (written) reconciliation of any major differences in the input data. This is done to insure that the best numbers or assumptions are being used, and that everyone involved in planning and approval agrees on the requirements.

RMA Planning Guide # 1108

Good Practice in Plant Layout & Facilities Planning


3.

Written list of key planning assumptions and discussion of their consequences if not obvious. Best practice is to rate the significance or import of the assumption on the plans being prepared. The assumptions list should be started early in the planning process and maintained as a “register.” It is typically reviewed periodically in attempts to resolve issues and uncertainties, and as later input to contingency plans.

Open issues should be resolved early in the project whenever possible.

4.

Involvement of a multi-disciplinary team, formally named by the overall project manager as the source of layout relationships and ultimately for approval of the plans developed. When too much of the work, and too many of the decisions are made by the layout planner, then oversights are sure to result. To guard against this, the planner should lobby senior management to name a team.

5.

Formal presentation and systematic evaluation of 2 or 3 significantly different alternative block or overall layouts. Typically, these alternatives are constructed to feature differing:
a. Flow patterns, such as straight-thru vs. U-shape (with combined Receiving and Shipping)
b. Storage concepts – central vs. decentralized; with and without mezzanines…
c. Directions of and reserves for future expansion

d. Placements of major “monuments” (fixed equipment such as drop hammers, autoclaves, process tanks, compressors, boilers, etc.)


Evaluation customarily includes cost and benefit comparisons, and participative, formal scoring of the alternatives by a cross-section of appropriate operating and support personnel.


When the project is to plan a new or expanded site, the evaluation should consider alternative site layouts and flow patterns and well as alternative building layouts.

6.

Effective use of color on drawings and presentations in order to highlight and help the viewer understand the amounts, kinds, and overall shapes of the proposed spaces and arrangements. Typically, aisle placement and storage areas are highlighted in this way.

7.

Use of colored overlays to show major movements of materials and flow patterns, and to help the viewer confirm that the layout minimizes material handling effort.

Overlays should indicate the material handling methods where known.

8.

Formal presentation and written reconciliation of all space estimates, in amount, kind, and shape or critical dimensions:
a. Between space currently used and projected future needs;
b. Between projected needs and the space actually provided in the various alternative plans.

RMA – 1108 © Copyright 2002. RICHARD MUTHER & ASSOCIATES

RMA Planning Guide # 1108

Good Practice in Plant Layout & Facilities Planning


9.

Well-documented support for any major reductions (or increases) in space, from present operations. Such documentation includes:
a. Written list of space estimating assumptions.

b. Calculations showing the effect of specific assumptions on space required.

c. Sketches where new, unfamiliar, specialized, expensive, or highly fixed equipment is the basis for the difference.

10.

No summary of space requirements without explicit, written presentation of an allowance for main aisle space. Without this, there can be no closure on the adequacy of the total space provided. (Aisles could simply be an afterthought and receive whatever is left after housing individual areas).

11.

No summary of space requirements without explicit, written recognition and discussion of building features, especially ceiling height and overhead clearance, floor loading and strength, column spacing, primary utilities distribution, docks and other major openings.

12.

Formal documentation of all activity-area relationships in the proposed layout.

Documented resolution of differences in desired activity-area placements as expressed by different client personnel. This is a universal problem in layout work.

The people involved will differ in their desires and reasoning. It is the job of the layout planner to achieve and document consensus on desired placement, clearly record the reasons therefore, and to quantify or rate the degree of desired closeness that will be observed during planning. The industry standard document for this purpose is the rated-and-reason-supported Relationship Chart, signed-off by the leader of the project and/or planning team.

13.

In the early stages of the planning, more weight should be given to the voice of operators and supervisors on matters of layout, material movement, and space requirements than to top executives. The planner should believe the operators and supervisors until it can be demonstrated that they are wrong.

14.

In the early stages of the planning, more weight should be given to the voice of “old timers” than to “new comers.” The planner should believe the more senior people until it can be demonstrated that they are wrong.

15.

If the top manager or new managers are at odds with old timers and operational management on matters of consequence, then the layout planer must tactfully surface and explain the consequences of such disagreements to all parties involved, and try to get them to agree. If disagreements remain, prepare a contingency plan around them.

16.

Formal risk assessment and contingency plan agreed to during approval of plans (so that consequences and redress of incorrect assumptions and inputs are themselves planned events). The contingency plan is thus a part of the total plan being approved.

17.

Hold detailed layouts of machinery and equipment, or limit these to critical areas until total space requirements and the block layout are established. When this rule is violated, the reviewers become so overwhelmed by the detail and amount of
information presented that they lose sight of the big picture and of what may be missing or not presented.

18.

When detailed layouts are presented, storage racks are included as equipment, the same as machinery. Leaving them out leads to oversights in amount, configuration, and accessibility, and to misunderstanding of material handling methods.

19.

Detailed layouts should show material handling equipment. Templates loaded with the largest pieces of material and placed in tightest maneuvering areas to provide visual confirmation are helpful. Material handling personnel should review the plans.

Typical checking points should include: docks, narrow aisle spaces or intersections, in storage racks, and at access and staging points to ovens, autoclaves, paint booths, etc.


In cases where clearance and maneuverability cannot be visualized in a two-dimensional plan view, the planner should provide elevation drawings or a 3-dimensional visualization.

20.

Finished layouts should be documented with adequate drawings and /or
specifications, so that suppliers of purchased equipment understand what they are bidding on, and so that the installation crew(s) can understand what is needed.


* * *
How does your project rate? If you are observing the 20 points above, chances are you will arrive at a good plan with minimal oversights and changes at installation time.

If you want to assure that these points are addressed on every project, then use our systematic planning methods. These include:
Systematic Layout Planning (SLP)
Systematic Handling Analysis (SHA)
Systematic Planning of Industrial Facilities (SPIF)

Good Practice in Plant Layout and Facilities Planning


Intangible Factors Influencing the Choice of Alternative Facilities

The following list of factors include those most commonly considered when evaluating alternative facilities plans for other than economic reasons. These are intended to be used with the weighted-factor method of evaluation as applied on RMA Working Forms 170 and 173.
In truth, each factor will affect costs, but in such a nonfinite or imprecise manner that estimates made for them would be misleading.
From this list, you can select those that are relevant to each particular project. Not all factors will be used; usually, some 8 to 20 factors are selected. Other factors not listed may be added to those selected for special projects. More frequently, two or three factors will be combined. Even more frequently, the wording of the factors and their descriptive explanations will be changed to make them more directly applicable to the specific project at hand. The factors must be made explicit and be clearly understood; otherwise, the weighting and rating are inclined to be cursory, inaccurate, and unreliable – all under the false guise of quantified objectivity.
Planners should note that the evaluation of alternative plans occurs several times in most projects, and that the factors are likely not to be the same each time.


FACTORS IN VOL VING NON-COMPANY PEOPLE

Compatibility with Legal Controls: The extent to which the facilities meet or comply with zoning regulations, building codes, waste control, environmental protection, pollution standards, labor requirements, and related legal considerations.

Procedure for Making Relationship Diagrams

Relationship diagramming is a central technique in Systematic Layout Planning (SLP).
The activity relationship diagram converts vowel-letter ratings on the relationship chart to a graphic visualization of desired closeness among activity-areas. In the space relationship diagram, each activity-area is drawn to scale, thus showing the relative size (and sometimes the shape) of each area, as well as its best-related position.
The procedure for graphically making an activity-relationship diagram, based on the relationships of activity-areas having been charted, is as follows:
Starting with Activity-area 1, see if it relates to any other activity-area by an A rating.
If so, diagram this by starting more or less in the center of a plain piece of paper. Draw the symbol for Activity-area 1; place the numeral 1 inside it; about a half inch to the right, draw the symbol for the A-related activity-area and place its number inside; then connect the two symbols with four straight lines. Keep approximately one-sixteenth inch between each of the four lines. In metric, space symbols one centimeter apart and keep approximately two millimeters between lines.
Continue down the row for Activity-area I, adding the respective symbol and number to the diagram for any A-rated relationships, placing each at the same half-inch distance from the symbol for the activity-area with which it bears an A rating. Continue for the row representing Activity-area 2, then 3, etc… Place these in the diagram, trying to maintain a half-inch distance between the symbols of each pair of A-related activity- areas. Don't try to look ahead. Progress down each of the rows until all A's are diagramed. Don't worry if you have to start a second partial diagram below the first that is not connected to the first; it will connect up later on.
Count the number of 4-line relationships and be sure it equals the frequency count on the relationship chart for the number of A ratings.
If there are more than six or eight relationships diagramed, the planner should redraw the diagram trying to get the symbols so located as to honor the half-inch distance for each set or bundle of four lines. Don't worry if the lines cross; don't worry if symbols hang off by themselves related only by one relationship.
After diagramming all A-rated relationships -- and redrawing, if necessary -- again go down each row, starting with Activity-area 1, and look for E-rated relationships.
Place these on the redrawn diagram of 4-line ratings. Place each symbol approximately one inch from any other E-related symbol, insofar as practically possible. Connect with three lines each pair of symbols representing an E-letter relationship.
Continue down the rows for all the activity-areas, diagramming E-rated relationships; count the number of 3-line relationships to be sure it equals the frequency count for E's on the relationship chart.
Redraw the diagram for best fit of A's and E's". Note: "best fit" is roughly that which makes the "area" inside each "band" of lines equal; but don't try for precision here. Of course, this redrawing may compromise the ideal of keeping the same distance between all symbols having the same relationship rating.
Continue similarly-down each row for the I's: add the related symbols to the diagram with two connecting lines; place symbols approximately two inches apart; count for correct number; and redraw the diagram. If either or both symbols are already drawn, connect them as they are located. Do not place any activity-area in the diagram more than once.
Diagram the O's the same way, placing them approximately three inches from other symbols having O-rated relationship. Ignore the U's. Diagram the X's with a zigzag or wiggly line. The zigzag is likened to a compressed spring pushing the symbols apart, just as the straight lines represent elastic bands pulling the activity-areas together.
Redraw the entire diagram for best fit. Check for inclusion of all relationships of each rating. Then color the relationships per the standard color code, which is similar to the sequence of the color spectrum.
You have now completed an activity relationship diagram. (See Figure on Page 3).
After determining the space required for each activity-area, and balancing the requirements against the space available, you are ready to make a space relationship diagram. The procedure is as follows:
Get a piece of gridded cross-section paper, preferably tracing paper, and establish a scale where one square equals a certain area.
Convert the space required for each activity-area on your space specifications sheet to a number of squares, at the scale established above.
Place the number of squares on the grid sheet "over" its respective symbol on the activity relationship diagram. Usually the "most-related activity-area" will be in the center and this is a good place to start.
Place the symbol and activity-area number inside the block of squares.
Add the number of lines between blocks as on the activity relationship diagram, letting them drift into each block for clearer legibility.
Honoring the relative positions of each activity-area, continue converting each to its respective block of squares.
When all blocks are diagramed, verify that they are all accounted for and that all relationship lines are shown.
Then color, or indicate by black-and-white shading, the type of space for each activity- area's block.
Note two things in addition: 1. The space relationship diagram will subsequently be adjusted to a conceptual or planned layout by moving the blocks together: 2. At the detail level of planning (Phase III), a template or drawing of each machine or piece of equipment will be used instead of a block of squares.

specialist in network planning, says
that you can ask three questions to
determine if there is a problem:

Action steps
If you find that improvement is
needed, Chandra Natarajan
recommends that you apply
Systematic Network Planning (SNP).
“It can be easily learned and applied
by any network manager, planner or
operations research team member” he
says. In its simplest form, SNP follows
six steps.

Step 1: Orient the project

variables into a model and software
tool, he recommends:
• Visualizing the lanes and nodes to
be modeled with a clear and
explicit diagram.
• Identifying and confirming data
elements and their sources, in
terms of specific information
systems, files, records or
spreadsheets.
• Publishing relevant constraints.
• Publishing the assumptions list.
• Writing out any formulas or
algebraic expressions that will be
used.
• Reviewing all documentation of
the intended variables with the
appropriate people.
Step 3: Analyze the sensitivities:
Chandra calls this the credibilitybuilding step. Here, you create a
validated baseline by comparing your
model results to actual performance
of the current network during a
recent period. Chandra says that it is
good practice to explain in writing
the variance in the model results.
This will help you and your team to
become better modelers by learning
from each project.

Step 5: Evaluate the alternatives:
Evaluate the network plans in a formal
way, scoring their performance against
a set of weighted factors or
considerations – recognizing that
lowest cost is only one factor. Common
intangible considerations include
business risk, ease of implementation,
effect on morale of the employees,
societal or environmental concerns,
image, and capital availability issues.
Step 6: Detail and Do: This is the
step where details are worked out for
the selected plan and then changes
are made to the network. To become
more effective in future modeling,
planners should be involved in
implementation. Says Chandra, “It is
important to work closely with the
operations team and to monitor the
effects of the network changes. Be
sure to perform a post implementation
audit to make sure the model’s
projected savings were achieved.”
This helps capture lessons learned for
future modeling.

While network planning requires the
use of software, Chandra says
“Software is only useful after you have

Step 4: Create the Scenarios: The
development and presentation of
multiple scenarios and plans is central
to Systematic Network Planning.
There are always two or more courses
of action and management will choose
more quickly and effectively when
selecting from a set of good
alternatives.
• Identify potential scenarios that
model the problem elements.
• Add or remove variables from the
baseline to represent each potential
scenario.
• Collect summary statistics for each
alternative plan and document the
results.
“Always develop two or more
alternatives, each with good features,”
Chandra advises. “Then involve your
operating personnel in deciding which
one is best.”

1. Quick start up on new projects – without
confusion on purpose, scope, and approach.
2. Finish on time or earlier than expected –
without delays, excessive iterations and
rework
3. Visualization of the network being modeled –
with clear and explicit diagrams of lanes and
locations.
4. Effective communication of model inputs and
elements – data sources, assumptions,
constraints, model structure.
5. Effective documentation of the analysis
performed – those not directly involved can
see and explain the work.
6. Formal evaluation of intangible factors in
addition to cost – ease of implementation,
business risk, flexibility.
7. Involvement of operations personnel –
especially in defining and evaluating
scenarios and plans.
8. Management chooses from multiple
scenarios – each of which is a cost-effective
course of action.
9. Ready acceptance of model outputs by
operations – without disbelief, objections,
challenges of results
10. Accurate results – actual results are close to
projected savings.

How to Plan a Manufacturing Cell
This Planning Guide explains step by step how to plan a manufacturing cell. It discusses
the information and analyses required at each step and the outputs achieved. Several types of
cells are discussed. Special issues related to automation are also discussed. A comprehensive
checklist is provided covering all major aspects of cell planning and operation, including
physical arrangement, operating procedures, organization and training.

BACKGROUND
Definition of a Manufacturing Cell
A manufacturing cell consists of two or more operations, work stations, or machines
dedicated to processing one or a limited number of parts or products. A cell has a defined
working area and is scheduled, managed, and measured as a single unit of production facilities.
Typically, a cell is relatively small, and may be virtually self-managed. Usually, the outputs of a
cell are more-or-less complete parts or assemblies, ready for use by a downstream operation or
cell, or for shipment to a customer.
Three aspects– physical, procedural, and personal – must be addressed when planning a
manufacturing cell. Cells consist of physical facilities such as layout, material handling,
machinery, and utilities. Cells also require operating procedures for quality, engineering,
materials management, maintenance, and accounting. And because cells employ personnel in
various jobs and capacities, they also require policies, organization, leadership, and training.
A cell is essentially a production line (or layout by product) for a group or family of
similar items. It is an alternative to layout and organization by process, in which materials
typically move through successive departments of similar processes or operations. This layout
by process generally leads to higher inventories as parts wait between departmental operations,
especially if larger batches or lots are produced. There is more material handling is required to
move between departments, and overall processing time is longer. Exposure to quality problems
is greater, since more time may pass and more non-conforming parts may be produced before the
downstream department notices a problem.

Benefits of Cells
The principal physical change made with a manufacturing cell us to reduce the distance
between operations. In turn, this reduces material handling, cycle times, inventory, quality
problems, and space requirements. Plants installing cells consistently report the following
benefits when compared to process-oriented layouts and organizations:
•

Reduced materials handling – 67% to 90% reductions in distance traveled are not
uncommon, since operations are adjacent within a dedicated area.

•

Reduced inventory in process – 50% to 90% reductions are common, since material
is not waiting ahead of distant processing operations. Also, within the cell, smaller
lots or single-piece flow is used, further reducing the amount of material in process.

•

Shorter time in production – from days to hours or minutes, since parts and products
can flow quickly between adjacent operations.

In addition to these primary, quantifiable benefits, companies using cells also report:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Easier production control
Greater operator productivity
Quicker action on quality problems
More effective training
Better utilization of personnel
Better handling of engineering changes

These secondary benefits result from the smaller, more-focused, and simplified nature of cells.
Difficulties in Planning & Managing Cells
To obtain the benefits of cells, planners and managers must overcome the following
difficulties:
•

Worker rejection or lack of acceptance – often due to lack of operator involvement in
planning the cell, or to insufficient motivation and explanation by management,
especially if the outcome is perceived to be a work force reduction.

•

Lack of support or opposition by support staffs in production planning, inventory
control and/or cost accounting – usually when creation of the cell causes changes in
procedures and practices, or reduces the amount of detail reported from the plant
floor.

•

Reduced machine utilization – due to dedication of equipment to cells and to families
of parts. In some cases, additional, duplicated machinery may be required. In other
cases, large and high-speed equipment that may be appropriate in a process-oriented
department or job shop must be replaced by slower and usually smaller, lowercapacity machines that are more appropriate to the volumes of a cell.

•

Need to train or re train operators, often for a wider range of duties and
responsibilities.

•

Wage and performance measurement problems, especially when individual and piecerate incentives are in use. The team-oriented nature of the typical cell and the goals
of inventory reduction may work against traditional incentives and measures.

TYPES OF MANUFACTURING CELLS
Cells take different forms based upon the characteristics of the parts (P) and quantities
(Q) produced, and the nature of the process sequence or routing (R) employed. The relationship
of these characteristics – P, Q, and R – and their influence on manufacturing cells can be seen in
Figure 1.

Figure 1. Key Considerations and Types of Manufacturing Cells. From the book: Planning
Manufacturing Cells, © Copyright 2002 Richard Muther & Associates.

Production Line, Group of Parts, and Functional Cells
Cells are typically used to serve the broad middle range of a Product-Quantity (P-Q)
distribution. Very high quantities of a part or product – typically above 1 million units per year
– lend themselves to dedicated mass-production techniques such as high-speed automation,
progressive assembly lines, or transfer machines. At the other extreme, very low quantities and
intermittent production are insufficient to justify the dedicated resources of a cell. Items at this

end of the P-Q curve are best produced in a general-purpose job shop. In between these quantity
extremes, are the many items, parts or products that may be grouped or combined in some way to
justify the formation of one or more manufacturing cells.
Within the middle range, a production line cell may be dedicated to one or few highvolume items. This type of cell will have many of the attributes of a traditional progressive line,
but is usually less mechanized or automated.
Medium and lower production quantities are typically manufactured in group technology
or group-of-parts cells. These are the most common types of cells. They exhibit progressive
flow, but the variety of parts and routings works against a production line.
If the processing steps are specialized in some way, requiring special machinery and
utilities, or special enclosures of some kind, then a functional cell may be appropriate.
Functional cells are often used for painting, plating, heat treating, specialized cleaning, and
similar batch or environmentally sensitive operations. If the functional cell processes parts for
other group-of-parts or production line cells it will introduce extra handling, cycle time and
inventory since parts must be transported and held ahead of and behind the functional cell. For
this reason, planners should first examine the practicality of decentralizing or duplicating the
specialized process(es) into group-of-parts or production line cells.
The steps required to plan a manufacturing cell are the same for all three types of cells –
production line, group technology, and functional. However, the emphasis and specific
techniques used will vary somewhat based upon the physical nature of the manufacturing
processes involved. For example, when planning for machining and fabrication cells the
capacity of key machines is critical and may be relatively fixed. The time required to change
from one part or item to another is also critical. Allowances for set-up and capacity losses to
changeovers are very important. Manpower planning may be of secondary importance, after the
number of machines has been determined. In contrast, when planning for progressive assembly,
the variability of operation times must be understood, and the work must be balanced among the
operators to assure good utilization of labor. In such assembly cells, utilization of equipment
may be a secondary issue.
HOW TO PLAN A MANUFACTURING CELL
Most cells can be planned using a simple six-step approach:
1. Orient the Project
2. Classify the Parts
3. Analyze the Process
4. Couple into Cell Plans
5. Select the Best Plan
6. Detail and Implement the Plan

This approach is fully-described in the booklet: Simplified Systematic Planning of
Manufacturing Cells, by Richard Muther, William E. Fillmore, and Charles P. Rome. See
Reference 2. A synopsis of this approach is presented here by permission of the authors.
Step 1. Orient the Project
The cell planner’s first step is to organize the project, beginning with a statement of
objectives, operational goals, and desired improvements. External conditions imposed by the
facility or the surroundings should be noted. The planning or business situation is also reviewed
and understood for issues such as urgency and timing, management constraints, or other policy
matters. The scope of the project and the form of the final output are agreed upon.
All cell-planning projects begin with a set of open “issues”. These are problems,
opportunities, or simply questions that will affect the planning of the cell or its subsequent
operation. These issues must be resolved and answered during the planning process. Typical
issues include: responsibilities for inspection and maintenance, cost accounting methods,
scheduling procedures, job design and training; in addition to physical issues related to available
space, equipment, and utilities. The planner and the planning team should list their issues at the
first opportunity, and rate the relative importance of each to the project.
Orientation also requires an achievable project schedule, showing the necessary tasks and
the individuals assigned to each. The essential planning tasks can be established using the sixstep procedure outlined above, adapted to the specifics of the project at hand. The final output of
Step 1 – Orientation can be summarized on a simple worksheet like that shown in Figure 2.
Step 2. Classify the Parts
Most projects have a candidate list of potential parts that could be made in the cell.
These parts typically have the same or similar routings. The planner must still clarify and
confirm that these candidate parts do belong in the cell, and identify those that do not.
Classifying the parts also simplifies the analysis and design of the cell. The first cut at
classification usually involves the physical characteristics of the candidate parts. These include:
•
•
•

Basic material type
Quality level, tolerance, or finish
Size

•
•
•

Weight or density
Shape
Risk of damage

Additional common considerations for classification include:
•
•
•
•

Quantity or volume of demand
Routing or process sequence (and any special or dominant considerations)
Service or utility requirements (related to the process equipment required)
Timing – (may be demand-related, e.g. seasonality; schedule-related peaks or valleys;
shift-related; or possibly related to processing time if some parts have very long or
very short processing times).

Less common but occasionally significant classification factors include building features,
safety issues, regulatory considerations, marketing-related considerations, and even
organizational factors that may be reflected in the way that a specific part is scheduled and
produced.
All of these factors can be tied together into a worksheet like the one shown in Figure 3.

The planner identifies and records the physical characteristics and other considerations for each
part or item. If it seems awkward to record or rate each amount or specific dimension, once can
rate the importance or significance of each characteristic as to its contrast or dissimilarity with
the other parts. Use the vowel-letter, order-of-magnitude rating code illustrated in Figure 3 and
defined below.
A – Abnormally great
E – Especially significant
I – Important
O – Ordinary
U – Unimportant
After recording or rating the physical characteristics and other considerations for each part or
item, note those parts that have similar characteristics – that is, classify the parts according to the
most important characteristics and considerations. Assign a class code letter to each class,
group, or combination of meaningful similarities. Enter the appropriate class letter code for each
part or item in the Class Identification column.

When a large number of different parts will be produced, planners should place special
emphasis on sorting the parts into groups or sub-groups with similar operational sequences or
routings. Those assigned to a class will all go through the same operations. Generally, for cells
producing many parts different parts, this is the most useful type of classification for the
subsequent steps in cell planning. The final output of Step 2 – Classify the Parts is a clear listing
of the classes or groups of parts to be produced in the cell.
Step 3. Analyze the Process
In Step 3, the planner uses charts and diagrams to visualize the routings for each class or
sub-group of parts, and then calculates the numbers of machines and/or operators and work
places that will be required to satisfy the target production rates and quantities.
If the cell performs assembly – like
that of the sheet metal oven shown in Figure
4 – the best way to visualize the process is
with an operation process chart like that
shown in Figure 5.
Figure 4. Sketch of the sheet metal oven
charted in Figure 5. The oven consists of a top
half, a bottom half, and a back, to which smaller
parts are added.

In addition to showing the progressive assembly of the finished item, the process chart
also shows the labor time at each step. Given a target production rate and the number of
working hours available, the planner calculates the work content of the process and breaks it into
meaningful work assignments. In this way, the required number of operators and workplaces is
determined, along with the flow of materials between them. Assumptions or calculations must
be made to establish the time that will be lost to breaks and to “non-value adding” tasks such as
material handling, housekeeping, and the like. The formal name for this process is line
balancing. A good line balance achieves the desired production rate with the minimum number
of operators and minimal idle time.
Once balanced to the planning team’s satisfaction, workplaces and equipment are defined
and represented in an Equipment and Flow Diagram. This is the final output of Step 3. See
Figure 6. In this example, scaled templates represent the equipment. Such graphic detail is
useful but not mandatory. A simple square symbol can be used to represent each operator
workstation, or each machine. Numbers of lines and lower-case letters designate the flow of
parts and materials.

When planning a machining or fabrication cell, the Group-of-Parts process chart is used
to illustrate the sequence of operations for each class of parts. See Figure 7.

When calculating the number of machines, planners must be sure to add allowances to
downtime, schedule interference, and changeovers between individual parts and groups of parts.
A good cell capacity plan meets the desired production rate with an appropriate number of
machines and level of utilization. Usually, the analysis will reveal over and under-utilization of
some equipment planned for the cell. If the analysis reveals over-utilization, the planner may
choose to:
•
•
•

Remove parts from the cell to reduce utilization of the equipment.
Purchase more equipment.
Reduce process, changeover, or maintenance times.

If the analysis reveals under-utilization, the planner may choose to:
•
•

Add parts to the cell to increase the utilization of equipment.
Remove parts from the cell to eliminate the need for the equipment.

Change the manufacturing process to eliminate the need for the equipment.
Leave the equipment external to the cell and route parts to it.

In machining or fabrication cells where the throughput is paced more by the operators
than the machines, the cell planner may need to conduct a line balancing exercise, in addition to
rough capacity and utilization analyses. In some cases, computer simulation may be useful to
examine the implications of changes to product mix and peaks in production volume.
Once the number of machines has been determined, an Equipment and Flow Diagram is
prepared, similar to that shown earlier in Figure 5. The Standardized Work form shown in
Figure 9 is a similar type of conceptual visualization that also illustrates operator times and
cycles.

Step 4. Couple into Cell Plans
A cell plan is a coupling of parts and process into an effective arrangement and operating
plan. It should include:
•
•
•

The layout of operating equipment (physical)
The method(s) of moving or handling parts and materials (physical)
The procedures or methods of scheduling operating, and supporting the cell
(procedural)

•

The policies, organizational structure, and training required to make the cell work
(personal)

The best way to begin this step is by sketching a layout from the Equipment and Flow
Diagram developed in Step 3. Once the machinery and workplace layout is visualized, the
material handling and any storage methods are determined. Material handling equipment,
containers and storage, or parts-feeding equipment are added to the layout. The planner also
adds any support equipment not already visualized in the workplaces, such as tool and die
storage, fixture storage, gage tables and tool set-up, inspection areas, supply storage, trash bins,
desks, computer terminals and printers, display boards, meeting areas, etc.
Once the layout and handling methods – the physical aspects of cell planning – have been
determined, the planning team turns its attention to the procedural and personal aspects. In our
experience, the procedural and personal aspects are often more important than the layout and
handling in assuring a successful manufacturing cell. These aspects include the procedures and
policies for staffing, scheduling, maintenance, quality, training, production reporting,
performance measurement, and compensation. In practice, some of these will have already been
determined during the layout and handling discussion; the remainder should be clearly defined
by the team and approved by management. The documentation of a viable cell plan will also
require the resolution of any remaining planning issues listed earlier in Step 1. The final output
of Step 4 is one or more documented cell plans. These will take the form of a layout with
associated policies and operating procedures like that shown in Figure 10.
Step 5. Select the Best Plan
In Step 5, the planning team and other decision-makers will evaluate the alternatives
prepared in Step 4 and select the best plan. Typically, this selection will be based upon
comparisons of costs and intangible factors. Typical considerations include:
Investment costs (and savings or avoidance)
•
•
•
•
•

New production machinery
Material handling equipment
Pallets, containers, and storage equipment
Auxiliary or support equipment
Building or area preparation

Costs are rarely sufficient for selecting the best cell plan. There are typically too many
intangible considerations involved. And in many cases, the costs of alternative plans fall within
a relatively narrow range. In practice, the final selection often rests on intangibles.
The weighted-factor method is the most effective way to make selections based upon
intangible factors. After making a list of the relevant factors, weights should be assigned to
indicate their relative importance. An effective scale is 1 to 10: with 10 being most important.
Next, the cell operating team should rate the performance or effectiveness of each alternative on
each weighted factor. It is important that ratings be made by cell operators and the appropriate
plant support personnel – those closest to the action and responsible for making the selected plan
work.
Since ratings are subjective they are best made with a simple vowel-code scale, and
converted later into numerical values and scores. The following scale and values are effective:
A – Almost Perfect Results (excellent)
E – Especially Good Results (very good)
I – Important Results (good)
O – OrdinaryResults (fair)
U – Unimportant Results (poor)
X – Not Acceptable Results

4 points
3 points
2 points
1 point
0 points
fix or remove from consideration

Rating values are multiplied by factor weights and down totaled to arrive at a score for
each alternative plan. If one plan scores 15% to 20% higher than the rest, it is probably the
better plan. If the costs are acceptable, this plan should be selected. If no plan scores
significantly better than any other, then pick the least expensive, or consider additional factors.
The final output of Step 5 is a selected cell plan.

Step 6. Detail and Implement the Plan
Once selected, details must still be worked out and preparations made to implement the
cell plan. Detailing should begin with an updated, dimensioned drawing of the selected cell
layout – typically at a fairly large scale, say 1:50. The detailing step should produce a scaled
plan view of each work place showing:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Normal operator work position
Location of tooling, gauges, controls
Parts containers, fixtures, and workplace handling devices
Utility drops and connection points
Door swings and access points on control panels and machinery
Position of overhead lighting

In some cases, an elevation sketch may be useful, showing vertical placement of work
surfaces, fixtures, containers, etc. Where highly fixed machinery is tied together with fixed
conveyors, or where robots are used, it may also be necessary to develop a 3-dimensional
computer model of the cell in order to simulate or test for interference and proper placement.
In light manufacturing cells – machining or assembly – where equipment is easily adjusted
during installation, this sophistication is typically unnecessary. Conventional plan views are
usually sufficient.
If space is available and time permits, great insight can often be gained by creating a lifesize mock-up of the cell, using cardboard, wood, light metal or plastic tubing. (See Figure 11).
By involving the cell operators in this mock-up, a great deal of useful detailing can be
accomplished in a very short time. In our experience, mock-ups provide two significant benefits:
(1) They uncover overlooked details that may be expensive to change later in implementation,
and (2) they obtain a much greater level of operator involvement and interaction than is possible
with an on-screen computer model, or with a 2-dimensional plan view of the layout.
Implementing a cell is an opportunity on a relatively small scale to make progress on
plant-wide improvement initiatives. The cell implementation plan should include tasks, time,
and money for the following common improvements:
•

Housekeeping & safety – disposition of unnecessary items, fixing of leaks, cleaning
and painting of machines, floors, ceilings, machine guards, aisle way guard rails and
posts, etc.

•

Visual Control – marking and striping, signs for machines and workplaces, labeling
for tool and fixture storage and containers, signal lights, performance displays.

•

Quality Management – certification of machine and process capabilities, tool and
gauge lists and calibration plans, mistake-proofing and failure analyses, control plans,
training, etc.

•

Maintenance -- repair and rebuilding of machines, replacement of worn-out
equipment, preventive maintenance schedules, operator maintenance procedures, etc.

•

Set-Up Reduction – video-taping, time- study, and methods analysis; redesign of
fixtures, tools, and machines; duplication of key equipment, gauges, and fixtures,
redefinition of responsibilities; training, etc.

Once the necessary tasks have been defined, they should be assigned to the appropriate
individuals, estimated in terms of time and resources, and placed into a schedule, recognizing
any dependencies between the tasks. The final output of Step 6 is the selected cell plan detailed
and ready for implementation.
MORE COMPLEX CELLS
Several considerations can complicate cell-planning projects. Chief among these is the
question of how many cells are needed. Given a set of candidate parts and their desired
production rates or quantities, the planner must occasionally decide whether a single cell is
appropriate, or whether the work should be spread across multiple cells.

When one or more cells feed others, the project becomes one not unlike planning a
“mini-factory.” (See Figure 12). Additional analysis is required to agree upon the materialhandling methods and scheduling procedures for moving parts between the cells. It may also be
necessary to share personnel or equipment capacity across the cells being planned. And, the
project may also have to decide on common policies (across all of the cells) for organization,
supervision, and performance measurement.

Even when planning a single cell, complications can be introduced if there is a wide
range of possible locations for the cell, the appropriate level of automation is unclear, or there is
the potential for radical organizational change, such as a move from traditional supervision to
self-directed teams.
Four Phased Approach
Complex cell planning projects are best planned in four overlapping phases.
I. Orientation
II. Overall Cell Plan
III. Detailed Cell Plans
IV. Implementation
The scope of these phases is illustrated in Figure 13. Specific steps within each phase are fullydescribed in the book: Planning Manufacturing Cells, by H. Lee Hales and Bruce Andersen. See
Reference 3. A synopsis of each phase is presented here.

Phase I – Orientation
Complex projects or those with very large scope may need an entire phase to determine
the best location(s) for the prospective cell(s), the handling to and from, the issues involved, and
the plan for planning the cell. Reaching sound decisions may require creating or updating a
master plan for the total facility. It may also require some conceptual planning of the
prospective cells themselves – hence the overlap with Phase II – Overall Cell Plan.
Phase II – Overall Cell Plan
In large or complex planning projects, Phase II defines the general plan for cellular
operations. This includes the number of cells and their respective parts and processes, and the
relationships between them. Block layouts are developed along with material handling plans for
movement to and from and in between the cells. General operating practices or policies are
decided. These planning activities and decisions are not addressed in the simplified six-step
approach described in the previous section, How to Plan a Manufacturing Cell. Reaching
decisions in Phase II may also require some detailed planning and design – and therefore
overlaps Phase III – Detailed Cell Plans.
Phase III – Detailed Cell Plans
Phase III details the individual cell(s) within the selected overall plan. The six-step
simplified procedure described in the previously is highly effective for purpose. At the
conclusion of Phase III, the planning team has identified the best detailed plan for each
manufacturing cell.
Phase IV – Implementation
In Phase IV, an implementation schedule is defined for each cell. On larger and complex
projects involving multiple cells, this schedule may span several months. It will typically
include many interdependencies between the individual cell installations, and changes to the
surrounding facilities, organization, and management systems. The team then obtains approval
and funding, procures necessary equipment and services, directs the physical and procedural
implementation, and debugs and releases the cell for production.
Impact of Automation & Technology
Most manufacturing cells consist of conventional, operator-controlled machinery and
equipment. However, in some industries and processing situations, highly automated machinery
may be used. For example, cells for high volume, repetitive welding may use robots instead of
human operators. The same is true with other hazardous operations such as forging. In high
volume assembly of many small or precision components, cells may consist of automated
assembly machines, and pick-and-place robots, often connected by conveyors. The entire cell
may be computer controlled, with operators providing service and material handling to and from
the cell. In some cases, the material handling may be automated using automated guided
vehicles.

In between the extremes of all manual or fully automatic operations, cells may include
some limited automation for parts feeding and loading, or material handling between operations.
A common example is the use of automatic ejection or unloading devices on machine tools.
These are typically used to present a completed part to the operator during the same cycle used
to manually load the machine. Other examples of selective automation include conveyorized
parts washers, curing tunnels, or similar process equipment. Typically the conveyor automates
movement between sequential operations without operator intervention or effort, and may drop
finished parts into a container.
If an automated cell with computerized controls is planned, extra attention should be
given to estimating the costs of equipment, software, systems integration, and to the ongoing
maintenance of the system. Adherence to sound technical standards and thorough
documentation of all computerized systems will help to keep these costs down. As noted earlier,
advanced visualization with 3-dimensional computer models is often valuable. Computer
simulation may also be used.
Use of automation and advanced technology in a manufacturing cell is most appropriate
when the following conditions apply:
•

Production volumes are very high, typically above 500,000 units per year, and
predictable or steady.

•

Product lives are relatively long (before extensive changes or reconfigurations are
required).

•
•
•
•
•
•

Product designs are relative stable.
Labor is expensive.
The company or plant has prior successful experience with automated systems.
The processes are hazardous or unsafe for human operators.
Very high repeatability and precision are required.
The processing technology is stable.

When several of these conditions are met, then at least one alternative cell plan should
make use of automation, to be sure that good opportunities are not overlooked.
CHECKLIST FOR CELL PLANNING AND DESIGN
Pages 23 - 27 contain a checklist and brief discussion of the most common choices or
decisions to be made when planning or designing a cell. The topics are organized around the
three aspects of cell planning discussed earlier: physical, procedural, and personal. The order of
presentation follows roughly the order in which the choices and decisions should be made during
a planning project – starting with the physical, followed by the procedural, and finally the
personal or personnel-related.
A more detailed and formatted version of this checklist may be downloaded in Microsoft
Excel format from www.hpcinc.com/rma.html. (Navigate: Downloads>Register>Form 760 1-4,

Physical Questions
Layout and Flow Patterns
1. Which material flow pattern should be used within the cell?
a.
b.
c.
d.

Straight-through
U-shaped
L-shaped
Comb or spine

Cells may be physically arranged into one of four basic flow patterns. (See Figure 14).
While the U-shape is frequently advocated and very common, the other patterns do have
occasional advantages and appropriate uses. Your authors believe that the best cell layouts
are achieved when the planning team forces itself to consider at least two alternative flow
patterns, if only to stimulate discussion.
Basic Cell Flow Patterns and Their Benefits
Straight Thru

1. Easy to understand, follow, schedule, and control.
2. Allows straight, inexpensive handling methods.
3. Easy access on two sides.
4. Avoids congestion at point of delivery and take away.

U-Shape or Circular

1. Automatically returns product, holding fixtures, and mobile
handling equipment to cell entrance.
2. Delivery and take away point are the same; allows
convenient handling to and from the cell.
3. Workers in center can assist one another more readily.
4. Easier to assign multiple operations to an operator.
Allows easier line balancing.

L-Shape

1. Allows fitting lengthy series of operations into limited space.
2. Lets feeding cells start on an aisle and end at point of use.
3. May allow isolation of dangerous or costly-to-move
equipment in the elbow, with savings in implementation
cost and/or two directions for expansion.
4. Easy to segregate in-flow and out-flow of physically different
materials, products, supplies, and special services.

Comb or Spine

1. Lends itself to two-way flow.
2. Well suited to cells with highly variable routings.
3. Allows "fingers/teeth" to be segregated for special
requirements.
4. Well-suited to functional cells.

2. How does the choice of flow pattern fit with the overall plant layout and material flow?
When deciding on the internal flow pattern for each cell, do not overlook its relationship
to and impact upon the overall plant layout. The layout of aisles and general flow pattern
in the factory may favor or even force a particular flow pattern within the cell.
Handling and Storage
1. What are the groups or classes of material to be moved? General categories to be
examined include:
a. Incoming parts and materials to the cell
b. Work in process between workstations within the cell
c. Outgoing parts and materials leaving the cell
2. Classes should be defined with an eye toward common handling and storage methods.
The classes for work-in-process should have already been defined through parts
classification and analysis of the process. But a review of incoming and outgoing parts
and materials may introduce additional classes, not yet identified or considered.
3. What handling equipment should be used for each class of material? Typical choices
include: forklifts, tugs and carts, push-carts, walkie pallet jacks, conveyors, slides,
chutes, overhead handling devices, or simply the operators themselves, hand carrying
parts or materials.
4. What containers or transport units will be used? Typical choices include pallets, skids,
bulk or large containers, small containers and totes, cartons, or in some cases, the items
themselves.
5. Where and how will materials be stored or staged? What equipment will be used?
Typical choices include: the floor, flow racks, shelves, pallet racks, cabinets, cartridges
or magazines integrated directly into machines, or directly on work benches themselves.
6. How much material will be staged or stored? Typically expressed in minutes, hours, or
days of coverage at an expected production rate.
7. How much staging or storage space will be required? And where should it be placed in
the layout?
Supporting Services & Utilities
1. What process-related supporting services are required? Space and equipment are often
required for tool & die storage, fixture storage, gage tables and benches, tool set-up,
inspection areas, supplies, trash, and empty containers.
2. What personnel-related supporting services are required? Typicals include: shop desks
and work areas; team meeting area; computer terminals and printers, telephones and
public address speakers, document storage, bulletin boards, etc.

etc.
3. Will special equipment be required?
4. What specifications or procedures are relevant or should be incorporated into the plan?

b. Manufacturing/process/industrial engineering
3. How will tooling be managed? Externally by a central organization, or internally within
the cell? Will tools be shared or dedicated to each machine?
4. Where will tools be stored? External to the cell? Internal? Centrally or at each work
place or machine?
5. Who will be responsible for set-up? External or internal specialists? Operators
themselves? Teams?
Materials Management

completed? First and/or last operation as performed? At the completion of each
operation?
2. How will reporting be accomplished? Using paper forms? Key entry? Bar code
scanning or other electronic method?
3. How will the cell be scheduled and by whom?
4. How will specific parts and jobs be sequenced? Who will be responsible?

self-directed team?
2. How will cell performance be measured and reported, and to whom?
Job Definitions and Assignments
1. Will new positions be required? Have they been defined?
2. Will cell operators be specialists or cross-trained to work anywhere in the cell?
3. Will operators rotate assignments on a regular basis?
4. How will the initial cell operators be recruited or assigned? Will the opportunity be
posted plant-wide?
5. How will future operators be assigned?
Compensation & Incentives
1. Will operators be compensated on a different basis from other parts of the plant?
2. Will operators be paid for skills or cross training?
3. Will a group incentive be used? How will it be calculated?
Systematic Planning and Involvement
The planner can generally achieve a good result by planning each individual cell with the
six-step procedure outlined in this Planning Guide. As each cell is planned, look first at the
physical, then the procedural, and finally at the personal aspects of the project. At every step, be
sure to involve prospective operating personnel and others from the relevant supporting groups.
Working as a group to answer the questions above will assure that the final, selected plan will
have a smooth implementation and deliver the benefits desired.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

SUPPORTING CONCEPTS

Mission
The mission of The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence is to create excellence
in organizations through the application of universally accepted principles
of operational excellence, alignment of management systems and the wise
application of improvement techniques across the entire organizational enterprise.
We do this by teaching correct principles and new paradigms that accelerate the
flow of value, align and empower people and transform organizational culture.

Vision
Our vision is to be the global standard of excellence in every industry; because
The Shingo Prize roots are in organizational recognition, we have learned three
very important principles:
Key insights from 25 years of organizational assessment
1. Evaluating organizations for recognition requires a clearly defined, very high and
universally consistent standard of excellence.
2. True excellence cannot be fleeting; therefore, assessment must determine the
degree to which the principles that create excellence are deeply embedded into
culture.
3. For any organization to be successful, they must be able to see the truth about
where they are in the development of a high-performing, principle-based culture.

Forward
Dear colleagues and friends,
In my associations, many people have asked
the following questions: How did The Shingo
Prize come about? How has it arrived where
it is today? And what does the organization
actually do?
As we release this new book, I’d like to
take the opportunity to tell you the brief
version of our story. My hope is that the
given context will provide you with additional
value as you study the Shingo model and
implement it as part of your organization’s
cultural transformation.
The Beginning
Few individuals have contributed as much to
the development of the ideas we call TQM,
JIT and lean as did Shigeo Shingo. Over
the course of his life, Dr. Shingo wrote and
published 18 books, eight of which were
translated from Japanese into English. Many
years before they became popular in the
Western world, Dr. Shingo wrote about
the ideas of ensuring quality at the source,
flowing value to customers, working with
zero inventories, rapidly setting up machines
through the system of “single-minute
exchange of dies” (SMED) and going to the
actual workplace to grasp the true situation
there. He worked extensively with Toyota
executives, especially Mr. Taiichi Ohno, who

helped him to apply his understanding of
these concepts in the real world.
Always on the leading edge of new ideas,
Dr. Shingo envisioned a collaboration with an
organization that would further his life’s work
through research, practical-yet-rigorous
education and a program for recognizing the
best in operational excellence throughout the
world. In 1988, Shingo received his honorary
Doctorate of Management from Utah State
University and, later that year, his ambitions
were realized when The Shingo Prize for
Excellence in Manufacturing was organized
and incorporated as part of the university.
In 2007, the organization was renamed The
Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence due
to its relevance within every industry – not
exclusively the area of manufacturing.
Guiding Principles and Shifting Paradigms
One of Dr. Shingo’s little known, but perhaps
most important contributions, was his
understanding of the relationship between
concepts (principles), systems and tools.
Unfortunately, over the years, most of us
have gravitated to and exalted the tools
associated with effective operations and
have paid too little attention to the power of
the principles. Dr. Shingo taught that
understanding the principles behind the tools
leads to higher-order thinking and answers
the question, “why?” When people

THE SHINGO MODEL

understand more deeply the why behind
the how and the what, they become
empowered to innovate and take individual
initiative. As more and more people within
a single organization begin to act
independently based on their understanding
and commitment to the principles, culture
begins to shift.
This fundamental truth is the basis for The
Shingo Prize and the Shingo model.
Building on the work of Dr. Shingo, the
mission of The Shingo Prize is to assist
organizations of all kinds to create lasting
cultures of operational excellence. We
achieve our mission by focusing our efforts
on timeless and universal principles.
As part of our efforts, we teach five
fundamental paradigm shifts:
1. Operational excellence requires a focus
both on results and behaviors.
2. Ideal behaviors in an organization are
those that flow from the principles that
govern the desired outcomes.
3. Principles construct the only foundation
upon which a culture can be built if it is to
be sustained over the long-term.
4. Creating ideal, principle-based behaviors
requires alignment of the management
systems that have the greatest impact on
how people behave.

4

5. The tools of lean, TQM, JIT, Six Sigma,
etc. are enablers and should be strategically
and cautiously inserted into appropriate
systems to better drive ideal behavior and
excellent results.
All Shingo recognition is based on the
degree to which these paradigms are
broadly understood and deeply embedded
into the behavioral fabric of an organization,
top-to-bottom and side-to-side.
The Shingo Standard: A Story
The Shingo standard is, by design, the most
rigorous in the world. We believe Dr. Shingo
would only want to associate his name with
the very best. Applicants for recognition are
held to an identical standard no matter
where they are located in the world.
Our standard has not always been so high.
For 18 years The Shingo Prize evaluated
organizations by noting their application of
lean tools, the quality of their lean program
deployment and, to some degree, the
engagement of their management teams.
This process consistently resulted in eight
to 10 organizations receiving The Shingo
Prize each year. All was fine until we realized
that it wasn’t.
We began to see small signs of fracture
along the edges. Critics of our selection
process began to emerge in blogs and
websites and eventually began to confront
us directly. There is an adage that states,
“Your best friends are the ones that tell you
the truth, even when it is hard to hear.”

Fortunately, we had very good friends in
the Association for Manufacturing
Excellence (AME) and the Society of
Manufacturing Engineers (SME). They told
us they were beginning to lose confidence
in recommending, carte blanche, our
recipients as benchmarking sites for their
members. As much as this hurt, it forced
us to begin a deep and earnest assessment
of our past recipients; specifically, which
ones had sustained their improvements
and which ones had lost ground. Our
findings were alarming!
We learned that even the best of the best
had an extremely difficult time sustaining
the gains we had observed during their
assessments. Furthermore, we discovered
that our assessment criteria had two major
flaws: (1) our standard for what excellence
looked like was based too much on
outward appearance and not enough
on the deeply embedded culture of the
organization, and (2) we did not know how
to accurately evaluate and measure the
truth regarding an organization’s culture.
Our insights sparked a yearlong study
to determine what did and did not work
in sustaining improvement efforts and to
understand the reasons behind success
or failure. At the same time, we began to
dig back through all of Dr. Shingo’s books
to see if we could discover what it was
that we were missing. To our surprise and
delight, working from either end and toward
the middle, we arrived at a unanimous
conclusion. The difference between
successful and unsuccessful efforts was

always in the organizations’ ability to get
past the tools, events and programs and to
align management systems with principles.
When such alignment took place, ideal
behaviors followed and perpetuated a
deep culture of operational excellence.
Based on our findings, we developed
the Shingo model that consists of an
organized collection of guiding principles
(the House) and a transformation process
(the Diamond). Together, this framework
has become the basis for everything we
do.
Education, Assessment and Recognition
The Shingo Prize has three areas of focus:
education, assessment and recognition.
We teach leaders to better understand
their role in building a culture of operational
excellence and we teach managers how
to better align systems to drive ideal,
principle-based behaviors.
Our focus on assessment is not as much
on awarding The Shingo Prize, but more
on using the Shingo model as the basis for
honest, self- and organizational-evaluation
and initiating lasting improvements to the
culture. In fact, we often say that The “True”
Shingo Prize is the culture of operational
excellence that comes from a disciplined
application of the Shingo model into your
organization.
Recognition is given each year to
successful challengers from around the

THE SHINGO PRIZE FOR OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

The Shingo Model
The search for improvement is instinctive.
For businesses and indeed any organization to be successful in the long term, they
must be engaged in a relentless quest to
make things better. Failure to make this an
organizational priority will inevitably result
in organizational decline. Excellence must
be the pursuit of all great leaders. In fact,
the passionate pursuit of perfection, even
knowing it is fundamentally impossible to
achieve, brings out the very best in every
human being.
Why So Many Fail
Improvement is hard work! It requires great
leaders, smart managers and empowered
people. Improvement cannot be delegated
down, organized into a program or trained
into the people. Improvement requires
more than the application of a new tool set
or the power of a charismatic personality.
Improvement requires the transformation
of a culture to one where every single
person is engaged every day, in most often
small, but from time to time, large change.
In reality, every organization is naturally in
some state of transformation. The critical
questions are, “To what end is the organization being transformed and who are
the architects of the transformation?” The
Shingo model of operational excellence

asserts that successful organizational
transformation occurs when leaders
understand and take personal responsibility for architecting a deep and abiding
culture of continuous improvement. This
is not something that can be delegated to
others. As the CEO of a very successful
organization recently said, “Leaders lead
culture!”
A Culture Built on Correct Principles
Stephen R. Covey described principles
as fundamental truths. He defined a principle as a natural law that is universally
understood, timeless in its meaning and
fundamentally inarguable because it is
self-evident. Dr. Covey taught that values
govern our actions but principles govern
the consequence of our actions.
Values are cultural, personal, interpretable
and variable. Our personal values influence how we see the world and ultimately
our choices for how to behave. Principles
govern the outcomes of our choices. In
other words, the values of an unprincipled
person will very likely lead to behaviors that
are far from ideal.
Principles govern everything that happens
in the natural world. Scientists the worldover continually search to understand

THE SHINGO MODEL

more of the principles that govern the
universe. They do not invent them; they
only discover their existence and seek to
do good by taking purposeful action based
on knowledge of the guiding principle.
Principles govern the laws of science; they
determine the consequences of human
relationships; and ultimately, principles
influence the successful outcome of every
business endeavor.

Principles Predict Performance
One of the most powerful aspects of principles is their ability to predict outcomes.
Principles govern the outcome or consequence of the behavioral choices we
each make. The closer our actual behavior
aligns with the ideal behavior that is linked
to the principle, the greater the likelihood
the outcomes of our behavior can be predicted. This is profound given that very few
things in any business can be predicted
with a high degree of certainty. A culture
where every employee understands and
is committed to principle-based behavior
will be a culture with a very high likelihood
of achieving predictably excellent results.
Similarly, a corporation not well grounded
in principles will result in a wide variety of
personal interpretations of how to apply
their values in work situations.

Why Operational Excellence?
For decades we have watched, and all
too often experienced, the disappointing efforts of programmatic improvement
initiatives, leaving in their wake a trail of

10

unintended negative consequences rarely
resulting in lasting improvement. Quality
Circles, Just-in-Time, Total Quality Management, Business Process Re-engineering, Six Sigma and, most recently, Lean
are a few illustrations of well-intentioned
initiatives that have far under-delivered on
their promised benefits. Our study of these
programs over the last 25 years has led
us to believe that the problem has nothing
to do with the concepts and everything to
do with the programmatic, tool-oriented
deployment of them.
The Shingo model is based on a systematic study of each of these improvement
initiatives. Our approach bi-passes the
tools that each program has engendered
and focuses rather on the underlying/guiding principles and supporting key concepts
behind them. We recognize the necessity
of good improvement tools but focus on
them only within the context of enabling
a system to better drive ideal, principlebased behaviors. The Shingo “house”
provides a summary and categorization
of this collection of guiding principles and
supporting concepts.
When taken in their totality, these timeless
principles become the basis for building a
lasting culture of excellence in the execution of one’s mission statement. We call
this relationship between business results
and principle-based behavior, “operational
excellence.”

Operational excellence cannot be a program, another new set of tools or a new
management fad. Operational excellence
is the consequence of an enterprise-wide
practice of ideal behaviors based on correct principles. As long as improvement is
seen as something outside the core work
of the business, as long as it is viewed
as “something else to do,” operational
excellence will remain elusive.
When leaders anchor the corporate
mission, vision and values to principles
of operational excellence and help associates to connect and anchor their
own values to the same principles, they
enable a shift in the way people think and
behave. Changing the collective behavior
of the group changes the culture. This
is a leadership responsibility that cannot
be delegated.

Principles of Operational Excellence
(The Shingo House)
In his book “Key Strategies for Plant
Improvement,” Dr. Shingo said, “Think
in terms of categorical principles.” The
Shingo house is a categorization of the
guiding principles of operational excellence. Associated with each category are
also listed many important supporting
concepts.
The principles are categorized into four
dimensions: cultural enablers, continu-

ous process improvement, enterprise
alignment and results – the ultimate end
of all business initiatives. These four dimensions overlay five core business
systems: product/service development,
customer relations, operations, supply
and a variety of management or administrative support systems.

Guiding Principles
The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence did not create the 10 guiding principles of operational excellence, but rather
they have always existed. In truth, there
is ample evidence that these principles
have been well understood, more or less,
at different times for thousands of years.
As the world has gone through cycles of
advancement and decline, it seems these
principles are routinely lost and forgotten and must be re-discovered. Emerging from the dark ages into a period of
enlightenment and industrialization, the
impact of these principles are only now
beginning to be understood again.
Certainly, and even surprisingly, most
business schools do not emphasize
these principles even though they are
the driver for business execution excellence. The cause for this may be that
these fundamental business principles
have been lost in management fads and
tool boxes that become programs or
“flavors of the month.”

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

SUPPORTING CONCEPTS

For organizations to be successful over the long term, leaders must deeply and
personally understand the principles that govern their success. Furthermore,
they must ensure the behaviors of every person who contributes to the business
are in harmony with these principles. In short, the organizational culture they
build must be grounded in correct principles.

Aligning the Systems with

All work in organizations is the outcome
of a system. Systems must be designed
to produce a specific end goal, otherwise
they evolve on their own. Systems drive
the behavior of people or rather they
create the conditions that cause people
to behave in a certain way. One of the
outcomes of poorly designed systems is

consistently bad behavior. Variation in
behavior leads to variation in results.

or a specific means to a specific end. Dr.
Shingo referred to tools as techniques
for problem-solving, necessary but not
sufficient. He taught that tools should be
selected to enable a system to perform
its intended purpose. In many ways, a
system may be thought of as a collection
of tools working together to accomplish
an intended outcome. A successful
enterprise is usually made up of complex
business systems that can be further
divided into layers of sub-systems, each
having embedded in them the necessary
tools to enable the successful outcome
of the system.

every level of the organization is able
to continuously innovate and improve.
Elimination of barriers to that innovation
becomes the responsibility of management.
Fundamental to the Shingo model is the
concept of teaching people the key principles (the “why”) behind everything they
do. When people understand why, they
become empowered to take personal
initiative. Managing a team of people who
share a deep understanding and commitment to the key concepts and principles
is much easier than managing the work
of those who are only doing what they
are told. Empowered employees who
understand relevant principles are far
more likely to make good decisions
about the direction and appropriateness
of their ideas for improvement.
Similarly, when employees have a clear
sense of direction and strategy and have
a real-time measure of contribution, they
become a powerful force for propelling
the organization forward.

Examples of Ideal Principle-based Behavior
Leaders

All leaders routinely spend time at the actual work locations where the
actual work is performed.
Leaders continuously seek the input of others, listen to their input and
adapt their actions based on what they learn.
Leaders in all areas demonstrate a willingness to learn and publicly acknowledge important insights they have gained.
Leaders take responsibilitiy for applying principles of operational excellence in their own lives and ensure these principles become the foundation of organizational culture.
Leaders engage people at all levels in defining ideal, principle-based
behaviors and support managers in the alignment of all business and
management systems.
Leaders develop systems to ensure they remain publicly accountable for
their own principle-based behavior seeking feedback from all levels and
across the entire enterprise.
Leaders ensure products and services do not have an unintended negative impact on the sustainability of communities and the planet.

Managers

All managers constantly work with others to better align systems with
ideal behaviors as defined by the guiding principles.
Managers act as coaches and mentors to others in the execution of
principle-based systems and are constantly receiving personal and organizational feedback for improvement.
All managers are visible in the work space and demonstrate an openness to listen and learn from others.
Managers across the enterprise ensure associates have the information
they need to be successful in their work and push decisions out and
down to the appropriate levels.
Managers create a safe and productive work environment, keeping the
safety of all associates as the highest of all priorities.
Managers regularly review the skills and competencies required of all associates and work with each one to provide appropriate opportunities for
associates to gain new insight.
Managers ensure appropriate systems are in place to protect the environment and support for the communities where they are located.

Associates

All associates, every day, demonstrate a commitment to the policies,
principles and standards developed for the areas in which they work.
Associates seek out and learn from others in the organization including leaders, managers and peers.
All associates take full responsibility for their own personal development
in relation to their contribution to the enterprise.
Associates demonstrate an eagerness to learn new skills, take initiative and
share their learning and success with others.
THE SHINGO MODEL

Dimension Two

22

D2: Continuous Process
Improvement
Continuous improvement begins by
clearly defining value through the eyes of
customers. Expectations must be clearly
communicated so systems can be designed to meet customer needs. Every
employee must know “what good is,”
whether his or her process is creating
good product or service, and they must
know what to do if it is not.
As associates learn to identify and eliminate waste, they will, by necessity,
follow Dr. Shingo’s advice: “Improvement means the elimination of waste,
and the most essential precondition for
improvement is the proper pursuit of
goals. We must not be mistaken, first
of all, about what improvement means.
The four goals of improvement must be
to make things easier, better, faster and
cheaper.” Particular emphasis is placed
on a quicker, more flexible response
throughout the system.
The focus for continuous improvement
cannot be only quality or cost but instead must incorporate all aspects of
value as perceived by the customer, including innovation, quality, cost, flexibil-

ity, quick delivery and a comprehensive
view of environmental health and safety.
Continuous improvement focused on
flow of value requires both scientific
thinking and the capacity to identify and
eliminate waste (things that interrupt the
continuous flow of value).
Principle – Focus on Process
A process focus recognizes that all outputs, whether product or service, are created by processes acting upon inputs.
This simple truth is often overlooked:
Good processes will produce the intended output, as long as proper inputs
are provided.
Process focus also helps focus problem-solving efforts on process rather
than people. A complete shift to process focus eliminates the tendency to
find the culprit (person) who made the
mistake but rather leads to a pursuit of
the real culprit (process) that allowed
the mistake to be made. Thus, process
focus also supports the cultural enablers,
creating an environment where learning

Principle –
Embrace Scientific Thinking
A focus on process lends itself to scientific thinking, a natural method for learning and the most effective approach
to improvement. All associates can be
trained to use scientific thinking to improve the processes with which they
work, creating a culture that provides
common understanding, approach and
language regarding improvement. Scientific thinking is also results-based,
placing a premium on defining and communicating desired outcomes throughout the organization.
There are a variety of models for scientific thinking, such as PDCA (plan,

Principle – Flow and Pull Value
Flow thinking is the focus on shortening
lead-time from the beginning of the value

and on removing all barriers (waste) that
impede the creation of value and its delivery to the customer. Flow is the best
driver to make processes faster, easier,
cheaper and better. Other potential drivers such as unit cost or process variability are too narrowly focused, distorting
priorities and delivering suboptimal results. A cost focus is particularly dangerous when it creates perverse incentives
and budget manipulations incidental to
actual improvement.

improvements, including better safety

with fewer defects, increases in ontime delivery and flexibility and lower
costs, without running into the traditional
trade-offs. In addition, daily and weekly
results become more consistent and
predictable.

Principle – Seek Perfection
It is important to understand that the
continuous process improvement journey has no end. This explains Dr. Shingo’s philosophy that one should always
look for problems where there doesn’t
appear to be any. This is contrary to the
traditional belief: “If it isn’t broken, don’t
fix it.” The pursuit of perfection reveals

Assure Quality at the Source

Seeking perfection and scientific thinking combine to find countermeasures,
not game-ending solutions, and then
revisits the issue again and again, pursuing perfection without really expecting to find it.

Stability is a prerequisite for improvement providing a basis for problem

Stability is the precursor to achieving

identification and elimination of waste.

Direct observation is a supporting principle tied to scientific thinking. It is in fact
the first step of the scientific method.
Direct observation is necessary to truly
understand the process or phenomenon being studied. All too frequently,
perceptions, past experience, instincts
and inaccurate standards are misconstrued as reality. Through direct observation, reality can be seen, confirmed
and established as the consensus.

While stability is a necessary precondition for creating flow and improvement,
standardization builds control into the
process itself. Standardization is the
supporting principle behind maintaining improvement, rather than springing
back to preceding practices and results.
Standardization also eliminates the need
to control operations through cost standards, production targets or other traditional supervisory methods. When stan-

dardization is in place, the work itself
serves as the management control
mechanism. Supervisors are freed up for
other tasks, when they are not “required”
to monitor and control the work process.

Focus on Value Stream

Flow and pull value combined with focus
on process lead to the necessity of defining value streams and focusing organizational attention on them. A value
stream is the collection of all of the necessary steps required to deliver value to
the customer. Defining what customers
value is an essential step to focus on
the value stream. Clearly understanding
the entire value stream, however, is the
only way for an organization to improve

the value delivered and/or improve
the process by which it is delivered.

Waste
Identify and Eliminate Waste
Identification and elimination of waste
is a practical concept for making processes flow, thus it becomes a primary
focus of continuous improvement. Waste
elimination is a powerful supporting principle because it is easily understood by
everyone associated with a value stream,
compared to the complex concepts and
computations often associated with cost
per unit, cost variances, statistical variability and other complex metrics. Focus-

ing on the elimination of waste will consistently drive appropriate behavior, while
the wrong focus can frequently become
a barrier to improvement, large inventory write-downs, fire sales or scrap.
One way to view waste is that it is
anything that slows or interrupts the
continous flow of value to customers. In the end, identifying and eliminating waste is a concept that effectively engages the entire organization
in the continuous improvement effort.

This concept is essential for operational excellence from many different

stop the process long enough to understand the root cause and take counter-measures that prevent the process
from reoccurring. For the leader, this
often means trading any short-term
loss for substantial long-term gain.
From a manager’s perspective, systems must be in place to ensure that
any result that varies from the standard, even slightly, creates an expectation of and support for immediate
action. We often call this “swarming.”

Data & Facts
Shingo emphasized the importance
of being data-driven in the pursuit of
continuous improvement. He frequently
shared examples of specific situations
where data was collected, but it was
not the correct data or the data wasn’t
actually being used in the improvement
process. Finally, he was adamant
that the understanding of the actual
process be so detailed that when

implementing a change in the process,
the improvement, as evidenced by
the data, could be predicted. Thus,
reconciliation is required between the
predicted results and the actual results,
making the improvement process truly
data-driven. The principle is that when
data is treated loosely or imprecisely,
there is a tendency to leave potential
improvement on the table or, even
worse, to not achieve any improvement
at all.

The following table provides examples of ideal behavior for leaders, managers and associates. The list is intended
to provide examples of ideal behavior that flow from this single guiding principle and should not in any way be
considered as an exhaustive list.

Examples of Ideal Principle-based Behavior
Leaders

Every leader devotes a significant amount of his/her time (up
to 80 percent) ensuring the principles of continuous improvement are deeply embedded into every facet of the organizational culture.
Every leader consistently evaluates their own behavior related
to each of the principles.
Leaders ensure continuous improvement is a part of their
daily standard work and are accountable to others for their
improvement.
Leaders in all areas create a healthy tension between celebrating accomplishments and setting goals to move to the next
level.
All leaders in every area of the organization encourage the
establishment of stretch goals and encourage managers and
associates to push themselves to levels of performance that
do not seem possible.

Leaders consistently ask for and expect to see the application
of appropriate tools to understand root cause prior to implementing countermeasures.
Leaders expect and support the role of managers in designing
and constantly improving systems at the business, management, improvement and work levels as the first course of
action when results are less than expected.
Every leader understands and balances the organizational
focus on both behaviors and results, holding themselves and
others accountable for both.

Managers

Managers in all areas devote a significant amount of their time
(up to 80 percent) ensuring the management systems of the
organization are perfectly aligned to drive ideal principle-based
behavior.
All managers participate with associates as required on improvement initiatives.
Managers demonstrate knowledge of appropriate tools and
use them regularly to solve problems related to their areas
of responsibility.
All managers watch for and appropriately recognize associates for both demonstrating ideal behavior and for achieving
business goals.

Associates

Every associate in every part of the organization is engaged
every day in using the appropriate tools of continuous improvement to eliminate waste and maximize value creation.
Associates everywhere seek to understand the principles (the
why) behind the tools (the how); they learn and use that knowledge to continuously improve the application of the tools.
All associates demonstrate the courage and integrity to tell the
truth, stop production and be accountable for defects they
observe or create themselves.
Associates share their expertise in developing best practice standard work and demonstrate the discipline to follow it until a better
way has been developed.

D3: Enterprise Alignment
One of the most significant failures of
modern management is its focus on

when business strategies are aligned
with correct principles.

strategy and planning without considering execution. To succeed, organizations must develop management systems that align work and behaviors with
principles and direction in ways that are
simple, comprehensible, actionable and
standardized. We call this “Principlebased Strategy Deployment.” Individual leaders cannot develop individual
approaches to management without introducing massive waste into an organization.
Strategy deployment requires a management system built around scientific
thinking, with more emphasis on cycles
of learning than on perfect plans. It is essential to establish effective communication, a process for gaining consensus,
clear accountability and systems where
execution and countermeasures are
planned and tracked, whether through

Principle –
Create Constancy of Purpose

change. Customers change, customer’s expectations change, competitors
change, markets change, technology
changes, leadership and management
changes, processes change, products
change, strategies change, even values

PDCA or a similar methodology. In essence, operational excellence is the definition of successful strategy deployment

32

Purpose, at the highest level answers the
question: “Why does this organization

exist?” It is incumbent upon leaders to
find agreement on philosophical and
strategic direction that provides a unifying vision. This sense of direction helps
people keep their eyes on the horizon
so that when tactical decisions require
a temporary detour, they understand
why and can contribute to getting back
on track.
The second category for where constancy of purpose can be achieved is
in the establishment of the guiding principles upon which the organization is
grounded. Principles are universal, timeless and self-evident laws that govern
the consequences of our actions. The
degree to which principles are adhered
will always impact the long-term success
of any organization. Leaders must come
to understand which principles have the
greatest impact on their results and then
make certain every aspect of the organization is aligned to drive behavior that is
in greatest harmony with the principles.
Having established direction and guiding
principles, a leader must align strategy
and performance metrics broadly and
deeply into the organization. A system
must be built to ensure constant communication, both up and down.
Changes in direction, guiding principles
and key metrics should be treated like

changes in the national constitution. Organizations that frequently redirect philosophies and strategies fail to recognize the tremendous waste associated
with instability, fluctuation and, perhaps
most importantly, the loss of human
commitment.
Principle – Think Systemically
Systemic thinking is the principle that
unifies all the other principles of operational excellence and enables organizations to sustain their culture of continuous improvement and develop a
constancy of purpose.
Systemic thinking requires organizations
to both analyze and synthesize. Analysis, or convergent thinking, is focused on
taking things apart to see what can be
learned from the various components.
We call this “looking into things.” Convergent thinking is what leads us to focus
on the “how.” Synthesis, or divergent
thinking, is focused on seeing how things
might work together. We call this “looking
out of things.” Divergent thinking is what
leads us to focus on the “why.” Operational excellence requires both.
Leaders realize that the impact of synergy — how things work together — is
far greater than the sum of the parts.
As managers design and align systems
with correct principles, they must shift

THE SHINGO MODEL

33

from thinking purely analytically to thinking systemically.
As managers move into systemic thinking, the full value of operational excellence is realized across the organization, the enterprise and ultimately the
entire value chain. As associates adopt
systemic thinking practices, they gain
the necessary perspective to safely initiate improvement projects on their own.
Ultimately, this understanding is what
allows improvement effort to transition
from being solely top-down to more of
a grassroots effort.

This is a very important concept. Most
managers and leaders consider themselves quite capable of seeing the world
around them and assessing the current
situational realities. However, Dr. Shingo
teaches that people can have blind spots
created by long-held paradigms, experience, history, expectations, etc. Thus
the practice of “go and see” was developed based on the principle that reality
needs to be perceived and understood
based upon the five senses.
Most organizations create barriers that
make it very difficult for people to see
and tell the truth about what they see.

A recently retired US senator wrote that
having travelled on numerous trips with
other political and military leaders to
areas of serious world conflict, his greatest disappointment was that virtually all
of their assessments of progress were
greatly distorted from the actual data
they observed.
Further, most organizations unintentionally build cultures that prevent the free
flow of information that communicates
an honest picture of reality. Max De Pree
said, “The first responsibility of a leader is
to define reality.” A leader must establish
systems that make organizational performance and associate behavior transparent to all.

Standardized Daily Management
The concept of having some level of

work can and should be organized into
standard components.
Standard daily management creates a
reference point from which continuous
improvement can be based. Standard
daily management can lead to greater
process control, reduction in variability,
improved quality and flexibility, stability
(i.e. predictable outcomes), visibility of
abnormalities, clear expectations and a
platform for individual and organizational
learning. Standard daily management
enables creativity that is focused and
controlled rather than ad hoc.
Leaders who follow standard work send
a clear message that they are serious

Examples of Ideal Principle-based Behavior
Leaders

All leaders share a common, clear and compelling vision of the
future and talk about it in a consistent way everywhere they

Leaders establish a simple system of metrics and accountability that aligns and prioritizes the work, decision making and
improvement efforts of the organization.
Leaders focus both on results and behavior, setting targets
and accountability for both.

Managers

Managers ensure a continuous flow of information (both
horizontally and vertically) to associates, making sure they fully
understand the context for their work and the goals they set.
Managers develop systems to ensure all associates understand
strategy, tactics and metrics and know how their work contributes.
All managers ensure people have enough information and a

Every aspect of an organization should

Measure what Matters
Historically, measurement has been focused on management – what management needed to know to be able
to plan, organize and control. Within a
model where widespread involvement
is essential for continuous improvement

38

and consistent performance, it is important to define measures that matter to
those who will be using them. Therefore,
line associates need different measures
than leaders responsible for the overall enterprise. Many thought leaders on
measurement have suggested the new
measurements need to: 1) be directly
tied to strategic priorities – move the
dial, 2) be simple and easy to capture,
3) give timely feedback that is tied to the
cycle of work and 4) drive improvement.
Measures that matter can be created
throughout the organization to assure
that everyone is focused on the appropriate strategic activities and driving
continuous improvement that moves
the whole enterprise ahead.

Supporting Concept
Align Behaviors with Performance

Ideal behavior drives long-term results.
This happens when the systems are
aligned with principles of operational
excellence. Managers should help each
person anchor their own personal values
with these same principles. Personal

values are what ultimately drive individual behaviors. Leaders are responsible for creating the environment and
the process for people to evaluate the
correctness of their own values relative
to the performance results required of
the organization.
One business set a goal to reduce customer complaints only to find that as
they did, they began to lose valuable
customers. The measure was driving
behavior that made complaining such a
painful experience that they just stopped
calling. A better measure might have
been to increase the number of complaints so that every single disappointment is given an opportunity to be resolved.

So, the “dial” is the speedometer. What
moves the dial? Pressing on the gas
pedal. Why does this work? Because
there is a physical linkage from the pedal
to the engine to the axle. There is a clear
cause-and-effect relationship.
Organizations must follow the linkages to determine the cause-and-effect relationships and how goals can
be achieved. This is the same concept
as root-cause analysis but applied to
creating value.

each process is “necessary non-valueadded work” that is currently vital to the
proper functioning of the organization
and the eventual effectiveness of the
value-added processes, (i.e., a company
needs to pay taxes), but the customer
doesn’t necessarily get value from the
process. Applying the principles to these
processes will help to make sure that
they are completed as quickly as possible with the fewest possible resources.

Summary

44

Summary
Operational excellence is the vision that
many organizations have established to
drive improvement. Programs, names,
tools, projects and personalities are
insufficient to create lasting change. Real
change is only possible when timeless
principles of operational excellence are
understood and deeply embedded
into culture. The focus of leaders must
change to become more oriented toward
driving principles and culture while the
manager’s focus becomes more on
designing and aligning systems to drive
ideal principle-based behavior.
The ultimate mission of The Shingo Prize
for Operational Excellence is to assist
organizations of all kinds in building
operational excellence. The Shingo
model may be used as a benchmark
for what excellence at the highest level
should look like. It may be used to align
all elements of an organization around a
common set of guiding principles and a
proven methodology for transformation.
Some use the Shingo model as the
basis for organizational assessment
and improvement planning. A few use
the Shingo model as a way to recognize
their associates for excellent work, and
others use it to demonstrate to current
and prospective customers that they can

compete with anyone in the world. Some
use the Shingo model for all of the above.
The real Shingo Prize, however, is
the business results that come from
the relentless pursuit of a standard of
excellence that is, without question,
the most rigorous in the world. Those
who use the Shingo model will embark
on a journey that will accelerate the
transformation of their organization into
powerful, dynamic, nimble competitors.
No obstacle – affordable healthcare,
efficient transportation, emerging
global environmental concerns – will be
beyond the reach of those who embrace
principles of operational excellence.
Leaders must make certain that every
person deeply understand the principles
that govern the consequence of their
behaviors.
Principles of operational excellence
are the only foundation on which
organizational culture can be built with
confidence that it will stand the test of
time. Cultures built on principles and
eliminate much of the normal variation
of business and, to a large extent,
become more predictable in their ability
to execute on business strategy.

Description automatically generatedWhy AutoCAD is better than Gut Feel for a Well-Design Warehouse Layout 

 

 

A warehouse layout is the arrangement of the warehouse, including the aisles, storage areas, processing areas, staging areas, and equipment. The layout of a warehouse can have a significant impact on its efficiency, productivity, and safety and overall performance of the warehouse. Designing a warehouse layout is a strategic task that requires careful planning and consideration to set the stage for success. In this post, we'll take a look at some key factors to consider when designing a warehouse layout, the process to follow, and why AutoCAD is a great tool to use for creating precisely designed drawings. 

When designing a warehouse layout, there are several key factors to consider: 

The type of goods: Different types of goods may require different types of storage solutions. For example, heavy pallets may need to be stored on pallet racking, while smaller items may be stored on shelves or in bins. You will need to decide better many trade offs between capital cost, storage density, and picking efficiency. Storage location sizes should be determined by the dimensions of the products and on-hand quantities you plan to store.   

The size and shape of the building: The size and shape of the warehouse will influence the layout of the aisles, storage areas, and equipment. For example, racking can only be as tall as what is safety permitted in the local jurisdiction, and may be based on the sprinkler system. If there are dock doors on 2 or more sides of the building, a cross dock material flow can be design. If dock doors are only on one side, a “U” shaped material flow is more common.  

The equipment being used: If you are using forklifts and pallet jacks, the equipment specifications will need to be taken into account when designing the layout. Aisle widths should be wide enough for two forklifts to pass side by side. They may also need to be wide enough so that a 90-degree turn can be made with the equipment to pick up the product. Do not forget that the lowered fork mast heights of forklifts need to be able to fit through drive through doors, and raised heights should be able to reach the highest rack.  

The needs of the team: The layout should be designed with the needs and safety of the team in mind. As an example, there should be enough room to travel around building columns without getting close enough to hit one. Column protectors and bumpers on racks are helpful to reduce risk if a collision does occur.  Shelve heights should also be designed at a reachable height to avoid stretching and reaching for average height pickers. 

 

There are many benefits of having a well-designed warehouse layout: 

Increased efficiency: An optimized warehouse layout can lead to a better use of storage space, reduce travel distances for workers and equipment, as well as improve picking and packing times. This can help to lower labor costs and increase daily throughput. 

Improved safety: A good warehouse layout can help to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries by providing clear and accessible pathways for workers and equipment. 

Reduced risk of damage to goods: A warehouse layout with the appropriate amount of storage capacity can also help to reduce the risk of damage to goods by ensuring that they are stored in appropriate locations and in a way that minimizes handling and the risk of accidental damage. 

Enhanced adaptability: A good warehouse layout can be more flexible and adaptable to change, allowing the warehouse to easily accommodate new types of goods or changes in the way goods are stored and handled. It is also critical to know the designed capacity of a warehouse, and at what level of inventory the building will be underutilized or overloaded.  

It is important to follow a process when designing a warehouse layout: 

Determine the size and shape of the warehouse. This will depend on the amount of space you have available and the type of goods you will be storing. 

Identify the different areas of the warehouse, for example the receiving area, storage areas, and shipping areas. 

Determine the types of storage you will be using, such as pallet racking, shelving, or bins. 

Consider the equipment you will be using, such as forklifts, pallet jacks, and conveyor belts. 

Develop a sketch of the layout on paper or a white board, refine with input from your team. 

Create a detailed, to-scale drawing in of the warehouse layout, including all necessary dimensions and details. 

One of the most effective tools for creating a detailed and accurate warehouse layout is AutoCAD. AutoCAD is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that allows you to create 2D and 3D drawings to scale with a high level of precision.  

Some of the ways in which AutoCAD can help you create a good warehouse layout include: 

Precision: AutoCAD allows you to set up a grid and snap preferences to ensure that objects are aligned accurately. You can also use dimensions and annotations to add precise details to the drawing. 

Professional-quality drawings: AutoCAD produces professional-quality drawings that are clear and accurate. This can be especially important if you need to present the warehouse layout to stakeholders or clients. 

Efficiency: AutoCAD can save you time compared to drawing by hand, as it has a range of drawing, editing, and measurement tools that can help you create accurate and detailed drawings more quickly. 

Using a Computer Aided Design process that helps develop an accurate warehouse layout is better than a gut feel guess. Miscalculating capacities or making poor design choices can have critical consequences that are expense to fix. Planning ahead with a few extra days in the design phase can avoid major headaches during implementation and day to day operations. 

Having a well-designed warehouse layout can lead to increased efficiency, improved safety, reduced risk of damage to goods, and enhanced adaptability. AutoCAD is a powerful tool that can help you create precise and professional-quality warehouse layouts, making it an excellent choice for optimizing the operation of your warehouse and improve overall business performance.  

Our team at Quadspace has many years of experience using AutoCAD, as well as the expertise to design a warehouse layout that will support your business needs. The best part is drawings are delivered within 3 business days, along with the designed capacity calculations.

In today's business landscape, sustainability and responsible business practices are gaining increasing attention. Companies are recognizing the importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations in their operations. These are three broad categories of criteria used to evaluate a company's sustainability and ethical practices. ESG encompasses a set of factors that measure a company's environmental, social, and governance performance.  

Environmental: This factor examines a company's impact on the environment. It considers factors such as carbon emissions, waste management, resource conservation, and environmental policies. 

Social: The social aspect of ESG looks at how a company interacts with and impacts society. It includes factors like employee relations, labor standards, community involvement, diversity and inclusion, and consumer protection. 

Governance: Governance refers to a company's leadership, structure, and policies. It assesses aspects such as board composition, executive compensation, transparency, accountability, and shareholder rights. 

The ESG framework is used by investors, financial institutions, and stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability and ethical practices of companies. It helps investors make informed decisions by considering not only financial performance but also a company's environmental and social impact, as well as its governance practices. Stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and regulators, are increasingly demanding greater transparency and accountability from companies. They seek assurance that businesses are operating in a sustainable and responsible manner.  

Companies that do not prioritize ESG face potential reputational damage, legal and regulatory risks, financial risks, investor concerns, challenges in attracting and retaining talent, and missed business opportunities. Governments are implementing regulations and disclosure requirements to ensure companies account for their environmental and social impacts. Compliance with these regulations is essential to avoid legal and financial consequences. Increasingly, customers and business partners prefer to work with companies that demonstrate strong ESG performance. Failure to meet these expectations may result in lost contracts, reduced market share, and limited access to collaborative partnerships. 

Focusing on ESG can bring several positive outcomes for companies. 

Enhanced reputation and brand value: By integrating ESG considerations into their operations, companies can build a positive reputation and strengthen their brand value. Demonstrating a commitment to sustainability, social responsibility, and ethical practices can attract customers, investors, and business partners who value responsible businesses. A strong brand reputation can lead to increased market share, customer loyalty, and competitive advantage. 

Improved financial performance: Research has shown a positive correlation between strong ESG performance and financial outperformance. Companies that effectively manage environmental risks, embrace social responsibility, and maintain sound governance practices are more likely to achieve long-term financial success. This can result from cost savings through improved operational efficiency, access to capital from ESG-focused investors, and increased market opportunities by addressing emerging sustainable markets. 

Risk mitigation: Incorporating ESG factors helps companies identify and mitigate risks. By addressing environmental risks, such as climate change, resource scarcity, or regulatory changes, companies can reduce exposure to potential disruptions, fines, and legal liabilities. Similarly, maintaining strong social practices, including employee well-being, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement, can mitigate reputational and operational risks. 

Access to capital and investor interest: Companies that prioritize ESG are more likely to attract investment capital. Many institutional investors and asset managers consider ESG factors in their investment decisions and portfolios. By demonstrating robust ESG performance, companies can access a larger pool of capital, benefit from lower borrowing costs, and potentially outperform companies with weaker ESG profiles. 

Increased employee engagement and talent attraction: Prioritizing ESG can boost employee engagement and attract top talent. Employees are increasingly seeking purpose-driven organizations that align with their values. Companies that integrate ESG principles into their culture and practices can create a positive work environment, improve employee satisfaction, and attract and retain motivated and skilled employees. 

Innovation and competitive advantage: Focusing on ESG can drive innovation and provide a competitive edge. Embracing sustainability challenges companies to develop new products, services, and business models that meet evolving market demands. By staying ahead of regulatory requirements and customer expectations, companies can differentiate themselves and seize opportunities in emerging sustainable markets. 

Stakeholder trust and social impact: Prioritizing ESG helps build trust and positive relationships with stakeholders. By addressing environmental and social concerns, companies can foster a positive impact on communities, employees, and the environment. Contributing to social well-being, supporting local communities, and reducing environmental footprints can generate goodwill, strengthen relationships, and enhance the company's social license to operate. 

When it comes to warehouses, reducing their footprints can have a significant positive impact on ESG goals. Many of the benefits are impactful to the Environmental Impact. By optimizing space utilization and implementing efficient warehouse design, companies can reduce their environmental impact. Smaller warehouses require less energy for lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation. This leads to reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, aligning with the environmental aspect of ESG. Sustainable warehouse design principles, such as natural lighting and energy-efficient HVAC systems, further improve energy efficiency and minimize the carbon footprint. 

Other positive impact on ESG goals: 

Resource Conservation: Reducing warehouse footprints helps conserve resources. Smaller warehouses require less land for construction and operation, preserving natural habitats and ecosystems. Moreover, they generate fewer construction materials, reducing resource consumption and waste generation. By minimizing the use of raw materials and optimizing space utilization, companies contribute to resource conservation and sustainable resource management. 

Cost Savings: Smaller warehouse footprints result in cost savings for companies. They require less investment in construction, maintenance, and operational expenses. Companies can allocate their resources more efficiently, potentially improving their financial performance. The cost savings derived from reducing warehouse footprints align with the economic aspect of ESG. 

Community Impact: Large warehouses can have significant social impacts on local communities, such as increased traffic congestion and noise pollution. By reducing warehouse footprints, companies mitigate these impacts, enhancing community relations and social responsibility. Smaller warehouses help alleviate the strain on local infrastructure, creating a more harmonious coexistence with surrounding communities. 

Adaptive Land Use: Reducing warehouse footprints allows for adaptive land use. Companies can repurpose vacant warehouse space or consider multi-story warehouse designs, maximizing land utilization. Adaptive land use contributes to sustainable urban development, promotes mixed-use areas, and supports community needs. It enables companies to make efficient use of available land resources while aligning with ESG principles. 

Innovation and Technology Adoption: Reducing warehouse footprints often requires embracing innovative technologies and practices. Automation, robotics, and advanced inventory management systems optimize space utilization and improve operational efficiency. These technological advancements foster innovation, aligning with the innovation aspect of ESG. By adopting such technologies, companies drive sustainable business practices and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive marketplace. 

In addition to warehouse space reduction, there are several other warehouse emphasis areas that companies can prioritize to improve their ESG practices.  

Occupational health and safety: Ensuring a safe and healthy working environment is an essential ESG consideration in warehouses. Companies can prioritize the health and safety of their warehouse employees by implementing safety protocols, providing proper training, ensuring ergonomic workstations, conducting regular risk assessments, and promoting a strong safety culture. This focus protects the well-being of workers and aligns with social responsibility. 

Ethical sourcing and labor practices: Companies can prioritize ethical sourcing and labor practices within their warehouses. This includes conducting due diligence on suppliers to ensure compliance with labor and human rights standards, fair wages, and safe working conditions. Engaging suppliers in responsible sourcing practices, such as avoiding child labor, promoting worker well-being, and respecting workers' rights, is crucial for maintaining an ethical supply chain. 

Supplier diversity and inclusion: ESG encompasses diversity and inclusion as a social aspect. Companies that prioritize ESG value supplier diversity and actively seek opportunities to work with diverse suppliers, including minority-owned businesses, women-owned enterprises, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Embracing supplier diversity promotes economic empowerment, fosters inclusive business ecosystems, and contributes to social equity. 

Transparency and traceability: ESG reporting and transparency are crucial elements of responsible business practices. Companies need to have visibility into their supply chain to track and monitor ESG performance throughout the value chain. Transparency enables companies to identify potential risks, ensure compliance with regulations, and provide stakeholders with credible and accurate information regarding their sustainability and ethical practices. 

Overall, ESG is important as it helps assess a company's overall sustainability, manage risks, meet stakeholder expectations, drive financial performance, comply with regulations, and act responsibly towards the environment and society. Reducing warehouse footprints is not only beneficial for individual companies but also contributes to broader ESG goals. By optimizing space utilization, implementing sustainable design principles, and embracing innovative technologies, companies can enhance their environmental performance, conserve resources, achieve cost savings, positively impact communities, and drive innovation. It's a win-win situation where sustainability and responsible business practices align with economic success. As the world shifts towards a more sustainable future, reducing warehouse footprints emerges as a vital step in creating a more responsible and resilient supply chain. 

Remember, every effort counts, and even small changes in warehouse footprints can make a significant difference. By taking this sustainable approach, companies contribute to a more environmentally conscious and socially responsible business ecosystem.

Why Inventory Analysis is Crucial for Your Business 

Inventory is a critical component of any business, as it represents a significant investment and can have a major impact on the efficiency and profitability of the company. That’s why it’s so important to regularly conduct inventory analysis in order to identify opportunities for improvement and make informed decisions about inventory management and warehouse space. Inventory analysis is the process of evaluating the level and type of inventory a company is holding. 

One high level metric used is Inventory turns, also known as inventory turnover, is a measure of how quickly a company is able to sell its inventory. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory for a given period. For example, if a company has an inventory turnover of 8, this means that it has sold all of its inventory 8 times over the course of a year. A higher inventory turnover indicates that the company is able to sell its inventory quickly and efficiently, which can be a good sign for the health of the business. A lower inventory turnover may indicate that the company is having trouble selling its inventory, which could be a red flag. 

In general, companies with higher inventory turns are more efficient and profitable, as they are able to generate sales without having to carry a lot of excess inventory. 

Another way of looking at inventory analysis is identifying slow-moving and fast-moving inventory items. Slow-moving inventory refers to products that sell slowly and have a low turnover rate. These items may be less important to a company’s bottom line and may require different management strategies in order to optimize their performance. For example, these items should be stored as densely as possible in a less preferred part of a warehouse. In contrast, fast-moving inventory refers to products that sell quickly and have a high turnover rate. These items are usually in high demand and have a short shelf life, so they need to be replenished frequently in order to meet customer demand. Fast-moving inventory is typically more important to a company’s bottom line because it generates a significant portion of the company’s sales and profits. These items should be stored in an easy to reach part of the warehouse. 

Investing in inventory analysis, and taking action based on the insights, can have many benefits for businesses. Some of the good things that can happen as a result of effective inventory management include: 

Increased efficiency: By analyzing inventory levels and types, you can identify slow-moving or excess inventory and take steps to minimize these items in order to improve efficiency and reduce waste. This can help to free up warehouse space, reduce carrying costs, and improve the overall flow of the supply chain. 

Increased profitability: By optimizing inventory levels and reducing excess inventory, you can improve profitability by reducing carrying costs and maximizing sales. This can be especially important for businesses with thin margins, as even small improvements in inventory management can have a big impact on the bottom line. 

Improved customer satisfaction: By forecasting demand and keeping the right amount of inventory on hand, businesses can avoid stock-outs and ensure that they are able to meet customer demand. This can lead to happier customers and increased sales. 

Enhanced competitiveness: By streamlining inventory management and increasing efficiency, businesses can become more competitive in their market. This can lead to increased market share and long-term growth. 

There are several methods that businesses can use for inventory analysis, including: 

ABC SKU analysis: This involves classifying inventory items into three categories (A, B, and C) based on their value to the company. “A” items are the most valuable or fastest selling and should be closely managed, while “C” items are the least valuable and should be minimized. Some companies even go to a “D” level to represent nearly obsolete inventory. 

Economic order quantity (EOQ): This is a formula used to determine the optimal quantity of inventory to order at a given time in order to minimize the total cost of inventory. The EOQ formula is: EOQ = √(2DS/H) where D is the annual demand for the item, S is the cost to place an order, and H is the holding or carrying cost per unit per year. 

Safety stock: This is an extra amount of inventory that is kept on hand to ensure that there is enough inventory available to meet demand in case of unexpected disruptions. The safety stock formula is: Safety Stock = (Maximum daily usage x Maximum lead time in days) – (Average daily usage x Average lead time in days) 

By regularly analyzing and managing your inventory using some of these methods, you can make informed decisions that will help to improve efficiency, increase profitability, and better serve customers. 

Taking all of this into consideration, our team at Quadspace focuses on 4 areas for monthly inventory analysis, to provide you with actionable and prescriptive solutions.

 A picture containing grass

Description automatically generatedBusiness can be a lot like Baseball, if you have a winning team:        Are you playing Moneyball?  

 

“It's unbelievable how much you don't know about the game you've been playing all your life.”   

- Mickey Mantle. 

Moneyball is a 2011 biographical sports drama film directed by Bennett Miller. The film is based on the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis, which is an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team's 2002 season and their general manager Billy Beane's attempts to put together a competitive team. The film stars Brad Pitt as Beane and Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, who Beane hires to assist him in identifying undervalued players. The working relationship between Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) is a central part of the movie Moneyball. Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a Major League Baseball team, and Brand is a young Yale economics graduate who Beane hires. One of the main takeaways is that it is a powerful combination when you combine a strong determined leader (Billy Beane), with a methodical analyst (Peter Brand). When they jointly made data driven decisions, it was so much better than traditional experience alone. 

One of the main themes of the movie is the use of sabermetrics, a form of data analysis that uses statistical and mathematical techniques to evaluate the performance of baseball players. Beane and Brand use sabermetrics to identify players who are undervalued by traditional measures and to assemble a competitive team on a limited budget. Beane impresses on his staff that they have to work within their constraints and make the best of it.  

Throughout the movie, we see the dynamic between Beane and Brand as they work together to build the team. Beane is the charismatic leader with a deep knowledge of and passion for baseball, while Brand is the analytical and strategic thinker who helps Beane see the game in a different way. As Beane says in the movie, "Adapt or die."  

The use of sabermetrics by Beane and Brand was innovative and game-changing because it challenged traditional ways of thinking about player evaluation and helped to create a more data-driven approach to building a competitive team. As Brand says in the movie, "The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency." 

Traditional measures of player performance in baseball, such as batting average and runs batted in, had long been used to evaluate players and determine their value. Beane and Brand, however, used sabermetrics to identify undervalued players who might be overlooked by these traditional measures but who could contribute to the team's success. By finding players who were undervalued by the market, Beane and Brand were able to build a competitive team despite having a limited budget. This challenged the conventional wisdom of the time and caused many people in the baseball industry to question their long-held beliefs about how to evaluate players. This approach was seen as controversial at the time and was met with resistance from some in the baseball community. However, their success on the field helped to validate their approach and eventually led to the wider adoption of sabermetrics. Beane tells his staff, we don’t need to see the game tape, we are looking at the stats. He describes it as being card counters at the blackjack table. 

The 2002 Oakland Athletics, managed by Beane and Brand, had a record of 103 wins and 59 losses, finishing first in the American League West division. This was the team's best record in 20 years. Despite having a payroll of just $41 million, the lowest in the major leagues, the team was able to compete with wealthier teams and reach the playoffs. 

The 2002 Oakland Athletics set a record for most consecutive wins in a single season with 20. This streak was the longest in American League history and tied the major league record. The team also set a record for most consecutive wins to start a season with 11.  

The story of Billy Beane and Peter Brand in Moneyball shows the value of having a data analyst on your team. In the business world, supply chain can be seen as a competitive sport, and it's important to have someone who can help you analyze data and make strategic decisions to stay ahead of the competition. By working together and combining their different skill sets, Beane and Brand were able to achieve success and outsmart their competitors. If you're a business leader, consider making sure you always have an analytical consultant, like an Industrial Engineer, on your team to help you make data-driven decisions. As the movie shows, the right person in that role can be a game-changer. Unplanned things are still going to happen, like blowing an 11 to 0 lead during a 19 game winning streak, but you can still come back to win that 20th game and break the record.  

Moneyball is a compelling movie that tells the story of how different skills and backgrounds were able to achieve success by working together. It's a tale of leadership, teamwork, and the power of unconventional thinking. The message of this book and movie really resonated with people, and the film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Brad Pitt and Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill.  

The Quadspace team wants to be a supporting actor in the film about your business and help you make history. Hire us today! www.quadspace.us or reach out to discuss more at info@quadspace.us

 Maximizing Success: How a Well-Crafted RFP Can Help You Find the Right 3PL Provider 

Selecting the right third-party logistics (3PL) provider is an important decision for any organization looking to outsource its logistics operations. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to find the right fit. This is where a well-written request for proposal (RFP) can be a game changer. An RFP (Request for Proposal) is a document that a company creates to solicit proposals from potential vendors or contractors to provide specific goods or services. An RFP typically outlines the project requirements, scope of work, timeline, budget, and evaluation criteria. Companies use RFPs to receive competitive proposals from vendors that meet their specific needs and criteria. The purpose of an RFP is to ensure transparency, fairness, and competition in the procurement process. In this blog post, we'll explore the importance of having a well-written RFP when selecting a 3PL. 

A well-written RFP is critical when selecting a 3PL provider 

Ensuring that all potential providers understand the organization's requirements and expectations: By clearly outlining the organization's needs, the RFP helps ensure that all potential providers understand what is required of them. This also makes it easier for the company to evaluate and compare proposals. 

Promoting transparency and fairness in the selection process: A well-written RFP helps ensure that the selection process is fair and transparent. It sets out the evaluation criteria and requirements, and ensures that all potential providers have an equal opportunity to participate. 

Standardizing responses from vendors: The RFP provides a framework for responses from vendors. This helps to standardize responses, making it easier to evaluate and compare proposals. 

Providing a clear framework for communication and negotiation: The RFP sets out the framework for communication and negotiation with potential providers. This helps ensure that there are no misunderstandings, and that negotiations are conducted in a transparent and fair manner. This can also help with keeping the selection process on time, meeting the intended target date.  

Helping to ensure that the selected 3PL provider is the best fit: By outlining the organization's requirements and evaluation criteria, the RFP helps ensure that the selected 3PL provider is the best fit for the organization's needs.  

Some of the benefits of having a well-written RFP include: 

Increases your chances of getting a 3PL interested in working with you, because the process is organized. Letting them know you are a serious buyer.   

Stronger relationships and partnerships with the selected 3PL provider. You will save yourself and the 3PL time by having all the required information together.  

Improved efficiency and cost savings through a more streamlined selection process. 

Better quality of service from the 3PL provider due to clear expectations and performance metrics. 

More successful implementation and transition to the new 3PL provider. 

Not having an RFP can make it more difficult for an organization to find the best 3PL provider for their needs and can lead to potential issues down the road. The risks of not having an RFP package can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including: 

Inconsistent responses from potential providers, making it difficult to compare and evaluate proposals. A different proposal format, structure, and level of detail can lead to confusion and inconsistency in the selection process. 

Unclear expectations and requirements, leading to misunderstandings and potential issues down the road. Misunderstandings and miscommunications can lead to project delays, cost overruns or inaccurate cost estimates.  

Lack of transparency and fairness in the selection process, damaging the organization's reputation and relationships with potential providers. 

Missed opportunities for cost savings and service improvements 

Difficult negotiations and implementation due to a lack of clear communication and framework. This can make it difficult to reach agreement on the terms of the logistics services and implementation plan. This can lead to delays, misunderstandings, and additional costs. 

How to create a well-written RFP for selecting a 3PL 

An RFP for a 3PL should be comprehensive and detailed, and should include all of the information necessary to ensure that the organization's logistics needs are met and that the 3PL provider is the best fit for the organization's requirements. Creating a well-written RFP requires careful planning and attention to detail. Here are some components when creating a successful RFP: 

Overview of the organization's logistics needs: This should include information about the organization's products, shipping volumes, distribution channels, and any other relevant logistics information. 

Define the scope of work and specific logistics services required: This should outline the specific services that the 3PL will be responsible for providing, such as transportation, warehousing, inventory management, order fulfillment, and other logistics services. 

Set service level requirements and performance metrics: This should include the performance metrics and service level agreements that the organization expects the 3PL to meet, such as on-time delivery, order accuracy, inventory accuracy, and other relevant performance metrics. 

Outline technical requirements and logistics technology: This should outline any specific technology or systems that the 3PL will be required to use or integrate with, such as transportation management systems, warehouse management systems, and your company’s ERP. 

Clearly define pricing and payment terms: This should outline the pricing structure for the 3PL's services, as well as any other relevant payment terms or financial considerations. Being clear about your expectations will increase the chances of getting what you want during negotiations.  

Evaluate the experience and qualifications of the potential 3PL providers: You should request information about the 3PL's experience, qualifications, and industry certifications, as well as any relevant case studies or references. 

Set out the timeline for implementation and transition: This should outline the 3PL's approach to implementing the logistics services and transitioning the organization's logistics operations to the 3PL. You should also be clear about response due dates, and the milestones of the selection process.  

Define the evaluation criteria and weightings for selecting the 3PL provider: This will be used to evaluate and compare the proposals from different 3PL providers, such as pricing, service level agreements, experience, and qualifications. A partner will be better able to share the information you are interested in, if they know what is most important to you.  

Selecting the right 3PL provider is critical for the success of any logistics operation. By having a well-written RFP, organizations can ensure that they find the right fit, improve efficiency and service quality, and avoid potential issues down the road. The importance of a well-written RFP cannot be overstated. It is the key to a successful selection process and implementation of a new logistics system. It is one of the best ways to ensure that the selection process is fair, transparent, and efficient, and can ultimately lead to better outcomes for your organization.

 You should forward that S&OP meeting invite to more Warehouse and Logistics Stakeholders  

 

In recent years, we have seen so many examples of how effective supply chain management is critical to ensure business success. One essential aspect of supply chain optimization is Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP). S&OP empowers organizations to synchronize their sales, production, and inventory plans, creating a seamless demand-supply alignment. However, to achieve a comprehensive and efficient S&OP process, it is imperative to actively involve warehousing stakeholders. In this blog post, we will explore the paramount importance of S&OP and provide valuable guidance on involving warehousing stakeholders to maximize supply chain performance. 

S&OP: Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) promotes effective coordination between different functional areas within an organization. The benefits of S&OP include: 

Demand-Supply Alignment: S&OP aligns demand forecasts with production plans, ensuring timely availability of products to meet customer demands while preventing excess inventory or stockouts. 

Resource Optimization: Organizations leverage S&OP to optimize resource allocation, including labor, equipment, and storage capacity, to meet production and customer service requirements efficiently. 

Improved Customer Service: By integrating sales and production plans, S&OP enhances customer service levels through accurate order fulfillment, reduced lead times, and improved on-time delivery performance. 

Cost Optimization: S&OP supports effective inventory management, minimizing carrying costs, reducing obsolescence, and improving overall operational efficiency, leading to cost savings. 

Warehousing is a critical component of the supply chain, and actively involving warehousing stakeholders in the S&OP process is essential for several reasons: 

Capacity and Constraints: Warehousing stakeholders provide valuable insights into warehouse capacities, storage constraints, and specialized facilities, enabling realistic and achievable production and inventory plans. 

Resource Planning: Collaboration with warehousing stakeholders ensures seamless synchronization of production plans with warehouse capacities, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing warehouse efficiency. 

Inventory Optimization: Warehouse managers contribute to accurate inventory forecasting, safety stock determination, and overall inventory optimization by providing insights into storage capacities and constraints. 

Customer Service Enhancement: Involving warehousing stakeholders ensures that the S&OP process considers warehousing capabilities, leading to improved order processing, reduced lead times, and enhanced customer service levels. 

To effectively involve warehousing stakeholders in the S&OP process, consider the following best practices: 

Cross-Functional Collaboration: Foster a culture of collaboration and open communication between warehousing stakeholders and other S&OP team members, including sales, operations, and demand planning. 

Regular Involvement: Invite warehousing stakeholders to S&OP meetings and planning sessions, encouraging active participation and soliciting their insights on warehouse capacity, storage constraints, and operational considerations. This is important all year long, but especially going into heavier sales time period with seasonality such as holidays or marketing promotions. 

Information Sharing: Provide warehousing stakeholders with relevant information from the S&OP process, such as demand forecasts, production plans, and inventory targets, while seeking their input on warehouse capabilities and limitations. 

Scenario Planning: Engage warehousing stakeholders in scenario planning exercises, considering different demand scenarios and evaluating their impact on warehouse capacity, storage requirements, and overall warehouse operations. 

Metrics and Performance Review: Include warehouse-related metrics in the S&OP process, such as warehouse utilization rates, inventory accuracy, and order fulfillment rates. Regularly review these metrics with warehousing stakeholders to identify improvement opportunities of to adjust models to be more accurate. 

Effective S&OP is vital for optimizing supply chain performance, and involving warehousing stakeholders is crucial for achieving comprehensive and efficient planning. By actively involving warehousing stakeholders, organizations can benefit from better demand-supply alignment, enhanced warehouse efficiency, improved customer service, and cost optimization. By adopting best practices and fostering collaboration, organizations can leverage the expertise of warehousing stakeholders and drive significant improvements in their S&OP processes, ultimately leading to a more efficient and resilient supply chain. 

If you don’t have an S&OP process, we can help you create one. If you have one, but there isn’t enough collaboration with the warehouse stakeholders, this is an easy fix. By integrating warehousing considerations into the S&OP process, organizations can unlock the full potential of their supply chain and gain a competitive edge in today’s rapidly evolving business landscape.

Measuring Warehouse Storage Utilization: How to Ensure Your Storage Space is Being Used Effectively 

Warehouse utilization is a key factor in the efficiency and effectiveness of an operation. It is about making the most of the available storage space, and minimizing the costs associated with warehouse. Warehouse vacancy rates have been below 5% in the US for the past several years, and that is not expected to improve soon enough for some companies. Available warehouse space is going to continue to be difficult to find. In 2021 warehouse rent costs increase by an average of 30%. It is imperative companies focus on effectively using the warehouse space they already have. In this post, we will explore some of the ways that a company can measure warehouse utilization and identify ways to improve it. 

Space Utilization: One way to measure warehouse utilization is by calculating the percentage of available storage space that is being used. This can be done by dividing the total number of locations used by the total number of locations in the warehouse. It may be helpful to run an empty bin report or physically go out and count empty locations. You should know how many total locations the warehouse has, especially because if you want to limit mixed SKU locations you need to have more locations than SKUs. A high space utilization rate is a sign that the warehouse is being used efficiently, while a low rate may indicate underutilized space. A benchmark Space Utilization goal that some companies use is 85%.    

Storage Density: Another way to measure warehouse utilization is by calculating the storage density, which is the amount of space being used to store each unit of volume. This can be calculated by dividing total volume of the warehouse by the total volume of stored items. This could be done in 2 dimensions by looking at total warehouse square feet divided by square feet per unit. It can be down in 3 dimensions by looking at cubic feet of the warehouse and the products. A high storage density indicates that the warehouse is being used more efficiently, while a low density may indicate underutilized space. Keep in mind that there needs to be enough space for traveling and processing. Aisles, work areas, docks, and staging areas are critical to the operations. You could exclude those areas from your calculation if you want to have a gauge of your storage areas separately. Keep in mind, higher storage density could lead to increased picking time if pickers are taking longer to search for or move inventory. The speed and accuracy with which orders are fulfilled is a key factor impacted by the warehouse layout. 

Inventory Turnover: Another metric to consider is inventory turnover, which is a measure of how often the inventory in the warehouse is being sold and replaced. If inventory turns are 12 times per year, inventory is turning approximately once per month. If Inventory turns are 4, inventory is turning approximately every quarter. A higher inventory turnover rate is a sign that the warehouse is being used efficiently, while a low rate may indicate. If you have low inventory turns you are paying more warehouse rent and holding costs to sell the inventory. Inventory turnover can be an overall business metric to assess cost efficiency.  

There are a few signs that a warehouse may be too full: 

Increased safety risks: If the warehouse is overcrowded, it can increase the risk of accidents or injuries due to tripping hazards or the increased difficulty of navigating the space. The more forklifts and equipment the warehouse has, the bigger the safety risk can be.   

Damage to stored items: If items are being damaged while in storage, it may be a sign that there is not enough space for them, and they are being crowded or stacked in a way that is causing them to be damaged. The more times an item is handled in the warehouse, the higher the risk of damage.  

Difficulty finding items: If it is difficult to locate items in the warehouse and there is extra time spent searching, it may be a sign that the warehouse is overcrowded, and the designed capacity is being violated. This can impact order accuracy. Ensuring that orders are fulfilled without errors or missing items, is important for customer satisfaction. Order accuracy can be calculated by dividing the number of accurately fulfilled orders by the total number of orders fulfilled. This gives you the percentage of orders that were fulfilled accurately. An increase in quality errors could be caused by operating over capacity.  

Inefficient operations: If it takes longer than expected to fulfill orders or if there are bottlenecks in the warehouse process, it could be a sign that the warehouse is overcrowded and not operating efficiently. If you see a decrease in picking productivity it could be time to assess your warehouse layout design.  

Challenges with On-Time Delivery: Delivering orders on time to customers is very important for customer satisfaction. If operators are searching for items, double handling items, or being less productive due to an overcrowded warehouse, it could lead to service failures to your end customers.  

Almost as harmful as an overutilized warehouse is a warehouse that is underutilized. This is impactful because it is costly. The budget spent on warehouse rent and racks could be redeployed for other important investments. There are a few signs that a warehouse may be underutilized: 

Empty or underused storage space: You can probably walk out of your office and look at this one. If there is a significant amount of empty or underused storage space or rack locations in the warehouse, it may be a sign that the warehouse is not being utilized to its full designed capacity. 

Honeycombing: This is a term to describe partly utilized locations. For example, if a location was designed to hold 10 pallets and there are only 5 pallets in the location. This overall degrades the utilization of the space. Some amount of honey combing is common and unavoidable. But honeycombing more than 30% could call for a redesign for smaller location sizes.  

High carrying costs: If the cost of storing inventory in the warehouse is a large percentage, or higher than the cost of the inventory itself, it may be a sign that the warehouse is not being utilized effectively and that the company is not getting a good return on its investment in the space. 

Continuously monitoring storage utilization and making improvements based on what that data is telling you is a beneficial focus area for supply chain and business managers. It is a challenging task, especially if information or resources are limited. There are many tradeoffs between storage density, picking efficiency, and capital expenses. The design decisions you make for warehouse layouts should balance your needs in these areas. Storage utilization is only one important focus area.

 Avoiding a Warehouse Log Jam: Play Tetris with Your Inventory 

Q4, the final quarter of the year, is an exciting and busy time for many businesses. Many eCommerce companies call it “peak” because sales spike up much higher than other parts of the year. A Q4 peak comes with many challenges, especially for warehouse and inventory managers.    

As the holiday season approaches and businesses prepare for year-end accounting, warehouses often find themselves facing a significant increase in inventory levels. This surge in stock can lead to congestion and inefficiencies if not managed properly. 

We like to think of planning warehouse space during an inventory swell like playing a game of Tetris, where the goal is to fit items efficiently within the available space. With this Tetris-like approach, you can maximize storage space, reduce congestion, and ensure smooth order fulfillment. 

The Q4 Inventory Challenge 

There are often challenges in warehouses during the holiday season due to a surge in consumer demand, requiring businesses to stock up on products to meet customer expectations. However, the consequences of a Q4 warehouse log jam can be dire including delayed order fulfillment, increased operational costs, and customer dissatisfaction. It's crucial to implement effective inventory management strategies to avoid these pitfalls. 

The Tetris Solution 

Imagine playing Tetris with your inventory. Instead of blocks falling from the sky, picture your products being efficiently placed on your warehouse shelves. This Tetris-like approach involves organizing and storing items in a way that maximizes space and minimizes congestion. 

The concept of Tetris as a solution for inventory management draws inspiration from the iconic video game created by Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. In Tetris, players must manipulate falling blocks, to fit them together in horizontal rows without any gaps. If you haven’t seen the Tetris movie, check it out on Apple TV. This simple yet addictive gameplay is all about spatial reasoning and efficiency—qualities that can be applied to warehouse inventory management. 

 

There are many benefits of better organization for your Inventory: 

Efficient use of storage space 

Reduced congestion and clutter 

Improved order picking efficiency 

Enhanced visibility of inventory 

Some Quick Inventory Management Tips 

Categorize Your Items: Group your inventory based on size, demand, and storage requirements. This categorization will help you allocate space more efficiently. 

Optimize Racking & Shelving: Make sure your racks or shelves are set up for your product sizes to utilize your storage solutions to their full potential. 

Leverage Technology: Real-time inventory tracking through software can help you stay on top of stock levels, making it easier to reorder as needed. Inventory management software, automation, and data analytics can help you adapt to fluctuating demand and optimize your inventory levels. These tools provide real-time insights, allowing you to make informed decisions and prevent overstocking or stockouts.

   Can you tell me about the business concept of the black swan? 

The concept of a "black swan" was popularized by the book "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In the book, a black swan is defined as a highly improbable event with three characteristics: it is unpredictable; it has a major impact; and, after the fact, it is rationalized by hindsight as if it could have been expected. 

The concept of the black swan has been applied to fields such as finance, economics, and politics, and it highlights the importance of preparing for unexpected events that have the potential to have a significant impact. In a business context, this might involve making contingency plans for unexpected events that could disrupt operations or having a plan in place to take advantage of opportunities that arise unexpectedly.

Great, can you add some more details about the black swan book? 

Sure! Here is additional information on the book "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable," which popularized the concept of the black swan: 

 

"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable" is a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, published in 2007. In the book, Taleb argues that history is characterized by unpredictable events that have a major impact, and that these events, which he refers to as "black swans," are often rationalized by hindsight as if they could have been expected. 

According to Taleb, black swans are characterized by three attributes: they are highly improbable, they have a major impact, and they are rationalized in hindsight as if they could have been expected. He argues that these events are difficult to predict, but that they have a significant impact on fields such as finance, economics, and politics. 

Taleb uses the metaphor of the black swan to challenge the way that we think about risk and uncertainty, and to argue that we should be prepared for unexpected events that have the potential to have a major impact. He also discusses the ways in which people often try to make sense of black swan events after they occur, and how this can lead to a false sense of understanding and a belief that such events are more predictable than they actually are. 

"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable" has been a popular and influential book, and the concept of the black swan has been widely applied in fields such as finance, economics, and politics. 

 

Great can you add together the previous two drafts? 

Sure, here is a combination of the previous two drafts that includes information on the concept of the black swan and its impact on the supply chain, as well as additional details on the book that popularized the concept:
